This playbook outlines a high-probability, short-duration scalping strategy designed to capitalize on temporary option premium mispricing following a sharp liquidity shock in the underlying index. The core premise is not directional prediction but exploitation of market microstructure: panic-induced option selling creates a premium collapse, and the subsequent mandatory hedging (gamma rebalancing) by market makers forces a rapid repricing when the underlying index retraces.

Instrument: Nifty Weekly Index Options (ATM) | Window: 9:25 AM - 10:30 AM | Holding Period: 2 to 8 minutes | Style: Reactive, rules-based scalp.

1. Theoretical Foundation: The "Why" Behind the Setup
1.1 Core Market Mechanism
Liquidity Shock: A sharp, impulsive move in Nifty (≥ 0.8%) triggers panic selling in options, creating a severe order-flow imbalance.

Premium Distortion: Option prices collapse (55-70%) beyond what implied volatility (IV) or delta would justify. This is a liquidity gap, not a fair value reassessment.

Dealer Rebalancing: Market makers, obligated to provide liquidity, absorb the sell flow. Their resulting short/long gamma position forces them to continuously hedge their delta in the futures market.

The Scalp Opportunity: When Nifty's momentum stalls and makes a minor retracement (often just 0.2-0.3%), the market makers' hedging activity in the opposite direction causes option premiums to snap back rapidly. The strategy captures this mechanical repricing.

1.2 Critical Greek: Gamma
Gamma (Γ) measures the rate of change of an option's delta. It is highest for At-The-Money (ATM) options with short time to expiry (weekly options). High gamma amplifies the effect of small index moves on the option's price and delta, creating the explosive re-pricing this strategy targets.

2. The Complete Setup: Criteria & Conditions
2.1 Prerequisites (Must All Be True)
Trading Day: Normal volatility day. Avoid: Major news events (RBI policy, Budget), scheduled data releases, or weekly expiry (Thursday) after 11:00 AM.

Time Window: 9:25 AM to 10:30 AM IST. This captures the post-opening volatility surge and peak dealer hedging activity.

Underlying Action: Nifty must print a single, strong impulsive candle (1-min or 2-min) on significantly elevated volume. The candle should have a large body with small wicks.

2.2 Signal & Entry Checklist
Monitor the following sequence. All conditions should align within minutes.

Step	What to Watch For	Visual/Data Cue
1. Impulse Move	Nifty makes a sharp, high-volume move down (for targeting CALLs) or up (for PUTs).	1-min candle > 0.8% move. Volume > 1.5x 10-period average.
2. Premium Collapse	ATM option premium plummets.	Premium drop of 55-70% from its pre-impulse level.
3. Momentum Stall	Index momentum dissipates immediately.	Next 1-2 candles show a small range, a doji, or a hammer. The low of the impulse candle is not broken.
4. Divergence Signal	Index makes a lower high or consolidates, but the option premium stops falling and begins to base.	This is the critical entry trigger. It indicates selling exhaustion and the start of dealer repricing.
5. Entry Confirmation	Index shows a minor retracement (e.g., breaks above a 1-min resistance).	Place a LIMIT order to buy the option at or slightly above the current ask.
Strike Selection: Only ATM or ±1 strike. Delta at entry should be between 0.30 and 0.55.

3. Execution Protocol: Entry, Exit & Risk
3.1 Entry Execution
Order Type: Use a Limit Order. Avoid market orders to prevent slippage.

Position Size: Risk per trade capped at 0.5% - 1% of total capital.

Mindset: Enter only if the divergence (Step 4) is clear. If the setup is messy, WAIT. No trade is better than a forced bad trade.

3.2 Exit Rules (Profit & Loss)
Profit Target: 25% to 40% of the option's entry premium.

Secondary Exit: If the index retraces 0.382 to 0.5 Fibonacci level of the original impulsive candle.

Stop Loss (ABSOLUTE):

Option Premium makes a new low below the entry bar.
Nifty breaks and sustains below the low of the original impulsive candle.
Time Stop: If the trade is not working within 3-4 minutes, consider an early scratch, even if stops are not hit.

3.3 Risk Management Commandments
No Averaging Down. Ever.

No Widening Stops. Ever.

Respect the Time Window. Do not trade this setup after 10:45 AM.

One Setup Per Day. If you miss the clean entry, do not chase. If you take a loss, stop trading this strategy for the day.

4. Example Scenarios
Scenario 1: The Textbook Scalp (Successful Trade)
Time: 9:32 AM

Action: Nifty, trading at 22,500, drops 100 points (~0.45%) in one large red candle on high volume.

Option Impact: The ATM 22,500 CALL premium collapses from ₹120 to ₹50 (-58%).

Stall: The next two candles are small and do not break the low.

Divergence & Entry: Nifty ticks up 15 points. The CALL premium, instead of falling further, holds at ₹50 and then jumps to ₹52. ENTER LONG CALL at ₹52.

Exit: Over the next 4 minutes, Nifty retraces 40 points of its fall. The CALL premium rallies to ₹68. EXIT at ₹68 (a 30% gain from entry).

Scenario 2: Failed Setup (Trend Day)
Time: 9:28 AM

Action: Nifty gaps down 150 points on negative global cues and continues selling in a series of strong red candles.

Why It Fails: This is a sustained trend move, not a single impulsive candle. The premium will keep falling in tandem with the index. The "divergence" signal never appears. Market makers are not forced to reverse hedge aggressively.

Trader Action: DO NOT ENTER. The setup is invalid. Recognize it as a strong trend day and stay out.

5. Tools & Mindset
5.1 Required Toolkit
Charting Platform: With real-time 1-min candles, volume, and simple drawing tools for Fibonacci retracement.

Option Chain Scanner: To monitor premium decay/rebound in real-time (e.g., Sensibull, NSE website option chain).

Fast Brokerage Terminal: Direct market access (DMA) or a very fast retail platform is crucial to minimize slippage.

5.2 The Trader Mindset
You are a sniper, not a machine gunner. Patience is the primary skill.

You are trading liquidity and dealer mechanics, not the index direction.

Process Over Outcome: Adherence to this strict protocol is the only measure of success. A stopped-out trade that followed all rules is a "good trade."

Appendix: Daily Preparation Checklist
Pre-9:20 AM: Check for major scheduled news. If present, shelf the strategy.

9:20 - 9:25 AM: Identify key support/resistance levels on the 5-min chart. Note the ATM strike.

9:25 - 10:30 AM: Actively monitor for the Impulse → Collapse → Stall sequence.

Upon Entry: Immediately set:

Limit order for profit target.

Mental or automated stop-loss.
