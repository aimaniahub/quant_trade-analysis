TRADE LIKE BERLIN 
 
The Education Wall Street Doesn't Want You to Have 
This book should not exist. 
In the world of professional trading, knowledge is currency. The strategies that consistently 
generate profits are guarded like state secrets, passed down through mentorship programs at elite 
prop firms, whispered in the back offices of institutional trading desks, and protected behind the 
walls of hedge funds where single traders manage portfolios worth hundreds of crores. 
Retail traders—the individual investors risking their own capital in the derivatives market—are 
not supposed to have access to this knowledge. The system is designed to keep them in the dark, 
feeding them outdated technical analysis, indicator-based strategies that stopped working a decade 
ago, and motivational platitudes disguised as education. 
The statistics tell the story: 91% of retail traders in India lose money in F&O trading. Not because 
they lack intelligence. Not because they don't work hard. But because they're playing a game where 
the rules are deliberately obscured, fighting institutional players with billion-rupee advantages, 
armed with nothing but YouTube videos and Telegram tips. 
I spent eighteen months observing Berlin—a trader who cracked the code, who survived the brutal 
initiation that kills most retail traders, who developed original strategies that exploit specific 
inefficiencies in the NSE derivatives market. Strategies with names you've never heard: Numerical 
Theory, Value Adjustment Theory, Adjustment Theory, Big Money Theory. 
Berlin didn't learn these from courses. He developed them through 10,000+ hours of screen time, 
₹70 lakh in losses that would have destroyed most traders, and the rare combination of 
mathematical precision and psychological discipline that separates the 9% who profit from the 
91% who don't. 
When I approached Berlin about documenting his methods, his first response was no. "Successful 
traders don't share their edges," he said. "Why would I create competition?" But that was his usual 
joke. He always said "In Trade Like Berlin, knowledge is always free. 
But he agreed—on one condition: "No fluff. No motivation without strategy. No theory without 
execution. If we're doing this, we give them everything. The actual frameworks. The real risk 
management. The psychological principles. Everything I wish someone had shown me ten years 
ago." 
This book is that promise fulfilled. What you hold is not entertainment. It's not inspiration. It's not 
a collection of trading stories designed to make you feel good. It's a technical manual for surviving 
and prospering in the Indian derivatives market. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Every strategy has been tested with real capital. Every rule has been forged through painful losses. 
Every framework has generated actual profits—not in backtests, but in live trading with real 
slippage, real emotions, and real consequences. 
You won't find these strategies explained anywhere else, because they're original to Berlin. You 
won't find this level of practical detail in expensive courses, because most course creators have 
never actually traded at this level. You won't find this psychological depth in academic textbooks, 
because professors haven't experienced what it feels like to watch ₹70 lakhs disappear over 72 
days and maintain absolute composure. 
But understand this: knowledge alone changes nothing. 
You can read every word, understand every strategy, and still fail if you don't apply the discipline 
these methods require. Berlin's frameworks work—the mathematics guarantee it—but only for 
those willing to follow rules when emotions scream otherwise, cut losses when ego demands 
holding, and let winners run when fear begs for early exits. 
This book will do one of two things: 
It will either transform you into a consistently profitable trader who operates with the calm 
precision of the 9% minority, or it will sit on your shelf as another book you read but never applied, 
another opportunity you understood but didn't seize. 
The difference between those outcomes isn't the strategies. They're already proven. 
The difference is you. 
Berlin has given you the map. The journey is yours to make. 
Welcome to the trading education you were never supposed to receive.

The Trader They Call Berlin 
Welcome to the Trading Education You Were Never Supposed to Get. Let me start with a question 
that will determine whether you're ready for this book: 
Are you tired of losing? 
Not just losing money—though I know that pain sits heavy in your chest right now. I mean losing 
sleep. Losing confidence. Losing the belief that you can actually make it in this brutal, unforgiving 
derivatives market. 
Are you exhausted from watching YouTube videos that promise "100% winning strategy" only to 
blow up your account when you try them? Sick of Telegram groups where everyone posts winning 
screenshots but vanishes during losing streaks? Frustrated with expensive courses that teach you 
technical analysis you can find free on Wikipedia, wrapped in jargon designed to make you feel 
inferior? 
If you answered yes to any of these questions, this book is your turning point. 
Not because I'll promise you'll never lose again. Not because I'll tell you trading is easy. 
But because for the first time in your trading journey, you're about to learn from someone who 
paid the full tuition the market demands—and survived to share the blueprint. The Trader They 
Call Berlin. 
This book documents the strategies, wisdom, and hard-won lessons of a trader known in Indian 
trading circles simply as Berlin. Not a celebrity with millions of followers. Not a YouTube guru 
selling courses from rented luxury. Not a "finance influencer" who's never risked real capital. 
Berlin is a trader who has been in the trenches of the NSE derivatives market for years, risking 
real money, experiencing real losses, and ultimately achieving real, sustainable profitability. 
I've spent months studying Berlin's methods, observing his trades, analyzing his frameworks, and 
most importantly—understanding the psychological principles that allow him to execute strategies 
most traders can't. 
What makes Berlin different? 
He lost ₹70 lakhs in 72 days and maintained absolute composure, knowing he was building a 
foundation. He made ₹10.75 lakhs in a single expiry day trade while his broker crashed and his 
phone overheated from recording the entire sequence. 
He's developed original strategies—Numerical Theory, Value Adjustment Theory, Adjustment 
Theory, and Big Money Theory—that exploit specific inefficiencies in the Indian derivatives 
market that institutional traders know but retail traders never learn. 
And most remarkably: He's willing to share these frameworks with you. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Why This Book Exists (And Why It Almost Didn't) 
Successful traders don't share their edges. It's an unwritten rule in the trading world. 
You develop a strategy that works, you guard it like state secrets. Sharing it means diluting your 
advantage, creating competition, reducing profitability. The best traders operate in silence, 
accumulating wealth away from public view. So why did Berlin agree to share his methods? After 
months of conversation, he finally explained his reasoning: 
"My strategies are scalable—a thousand more traders knowing them won't diminish my edge. And 
I remember what it felt like to be lost, confused, bleeding capital, wondering if trading success 
was even real. If I can compress ten years of painful learning into one book that someone can read 
in a week, that's worth more than keeping secrets. In Trade Like Berlin Knowledge is Free ” 
This book is the shortcut Berlin wishes existed when he started. Not a shortcut to riches—those 
don't exist. But a shortcut through the darkness, the confusion, the expensive mistakes that he made 
so you don't have to. 
I'm simply the translator. The observer. The documentarian of a trading genius who believes 
education should replace deception in an industry filled with false prophets. 
What Makes This Book Different From Everything Else You've Read? 
Walk into any bookstore. Check Amazon. You'll find hundreds of trading books. 95% of them are 
worthless. They fall into predictable categories: 
Category 1: The Academic Textbook 
Written by professors who've never risked ₹1,000 of their own money. Filled with Greeks 
formulas, Black-Scholes models, and theoretical frameworks that sound impressive but fail 
catastrophically in real market conditions. 
Category 2: The Motivational Fluff 
"Believe in yourself! Visualize success!" Zero actionable strategies. Just feel-good platitudes that 
leave you motivated for three days before the market humbles you again. 
Category 3: The Indicator Salad 
"Use the 21 EMA with RSI divergence, MACD crossover, and Fibonacci confluence!" Looks 
impressive on charts. Fails in live trading because the market doesn't care about your indicator 
combinations. 
Category 4: The Recycled Basics 


=== PAGE {} ===
Support and resistance. Candlestick patterns. Risk management defined as "don't risk more than 
2%." Nothing new. Nothing that helps you make money tomorrow at 9:15 AM. 
This book is none of those. This is a field manual written by someone who observed a master 
trader survive what kills 91% of retail traders. 
Every strategy documented here: 
 
Has been tested with real capital (Berlin's) 
 
Has survived multiple market conditions (bull runs, crashes, consolidations) 
 
Is specifically designed for the Indian derivatives market (NSE, Nifty, Bank Nifty) 
 
Comes with actual risk management frameworks that kept Berlin alive during ₹70 lakh 
drawdowns 
 
Is explained with real trade examples, including failures and recovery processes 
You won't find these strategies on YouTube. You won't find them in academic papers. You won't 
find them taught in expensive courses. Because they're not theoretical. They're not imported from 
US markets and awkwardly adapted to India. They're not designed to sound smart. They're 
designed to make money in the specific chaos of NSE derivatives expiry days, intraday volatility, 
and the unique retail-institutional dynamics of the Indian market. 
The Fortune of Timing: Why You're Lucky to Be Reading This. Successful traders don't write 
books. They're too busy compounding wealth. The fact that this book exists at all represents a rare 
alignment of circumstances: 
Berlin reached a knoledge level where sharing doesn't threaten his edge. His strategies matured to 
the point where they're teachable without losing effectiveness. And he developed the desire to give 
back to a community that was once as lost as he was. 
Ten years ago, this book couldn't exist—Berlin was still learning. Five years from now, it 
might not exist—Berlin may return to operating in silence. 
You're reading it at the exact right moment—when a master trader is willing to be documented. 
That's not luck. That's opportunity meeting your readiness to learn. But here's the catch: These 
strategies are powerful, but they can't make you rich by themselves. This book is a map through 
dangerous terrain that Berlin has already crossed, marked with every trap he fell into and every 
shortcut he discovered. You still have to make the journey. But now you won't be walking blind. 
The Promise: What This Book Will Do For You (If You Let It) 
Let me make a promise that sounds bold but is simply mathematical truth: 
If you read this book completely, practice the strategies with discipline, follow the rules without 
deviation, and give yourself 6-12 months of consistent application, you will be profitable. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Not "might be." Not "could be." Will be. 
How can I make this promise? Because the strategies documented here aren't based on prediction 
or luck. They're based on: 
Probability – Playing setups with statistical edges (65-85% win rates on certain patterns) 
Mathematics – Risk-reward ratios that ensure profitability even with 40% win rates 
Psychology – Rules that prevent emotional mistakes that blow up accounts 
Market Structure – Understanding how institutional money moves and how to follow their 
footprints 
When you combine these four elements with discipline, profitability becomes inevitable. 
The only variable is you. Will you follow the instructions? Will you practice before going live? 
Will you honor stop losses when every fiber of your being screams to hold? 
If yes, this book will transform you from a struggling trader into a consistently profitable one. Not 
overnight. Not without effort. Not without occasional losses. But transform you nonetheless. 
What You're About to Learn: The Curriculum That Changes Lives. This book is structured as a 
complete trading education, from foundational psychology to advanced strategies. 
Here's the journey ahead: 
Before teaching any strategy, the book addresses why 91% of retail traders lose money in F&O 
while 9% consistently profit. The difference isn't intelligence. It's rules. 
You'll discover the 40+ principles Berlin follows religiously: 
- Why you should never look for reversals in trending markets 
- How to control position sizing to survive inevitable drawdowns 
- The statistical edge of monthly expiries (80-90% close positive) 
- The 50% rule that prevents winning days from becoming losing days 
- How to cooperate with the market instead of fighting it 
- Why thinking like 90% of traders guarantees losses 
- The holding discipline that transforms ₹50,000 trades into ₹5,00,000 outcomes 


=== PAGE {} ===
This foundation is crucial. Berlin's advanced strategies without proper psychological grounding 
are like giving a Ferrari to someone who can't drive. After this section, you'll understand precisely 
why you've been losing and exactly what must change. 
NUMERICAL THEORY – Simplicity at Scale 
The simplest strategy in the book, yet devastatingly effective. Numerical Theory operates on one 
observation: When a stock moves 3%+ in either direction, momentum usually continues if you 
enter at precisely the right moment. This strategy alone, mastered and applied consistently, can 
generate 3-5% monthly returns. But it's merely the beginning. 
VALUE ADJUSTMENT THEORY – Exploiting Premium Inefficiency 
This is where Berlin's genius becomes evident. On expiry days (particularly ex-d2, ex-d1, and ex-
d0), option premiums don't maintain neat mathematical relationships. Emotions, volatility spikes, 
and order flow create exploitable dislocations. Value Adjustment Theory teaches you to identify 
when an option is undervalued relative to its equidistant strike and profit from the inevitable 
reversion. 
Why this works: Institutional money created the dislocation and will either rebalance it or 
momentum will force pricing correction. 
The chapter covers: 
- Real-time value adjustment calculations 
- Entry timing precision (not every gap is tradeable) 
- Optimal windows (expiry day, 10 AM - 3 PM) 
- Strategy-specific risk management 
- Why this demands extensive practice 
This strategy, combined with Numerical Theory, can generate 8-12% monthly returns. 
ADJUSTMENT THEORY – Scalping the Final Chaos 
Different from Value Adjustment, this targets the last 15-30 minutes of expiry day. The insight: In 
the final minutes before expiry, markets "adjust" through micro-oscillations as premiums converge 
toward zero. These adjustments create temporary gaps between ATM call and put premiums. 
Berlin's edge: Buy the undervalued leg when gaps widen, sell when rebalancing occurs (typically 
5-15 minutes). 
BIG MONEY THEORY – Following the Elephants 


=== PAGE {} ===
This is Berlin's masterpiece. The strategy institutional traders don't want retail to understand. Big 
Money Theory premise: Identify where institutional players accumulated positions through block 
orders, then enter at those identical price levels on expiry day when premiums return there. 
The logic: Elephants leave footprints. When they enter at ₹50, that level becomes magnetic. If 
premiums return to ₹50, either they're defending the level or re-entering positions. 
You'll learn: 
- Spotting block orders and genuine accumulation zones 
- Differentiating real accumulation from random consolidation 
- Entry methodology (waiting for zone retests) 
- Risk management (5% maximum per trade, two trades maximum daily) 
- The critical "let winners ride" philosophy 
This strategy has the highest return potential but requires the most discipline. 65% success rate + 
1:3 risk-reward + letting select winners run to 100-200% = life-changing monthly returns. 
MONEY MANAGEMENT – The 80% That Determines Everything 
Berlin repeats this constantly: 
"Trading is 20% strategy, 80% money management." The best strategy won't save you if you: 
- Risk 20% per trade 
- Hold losers hoping for recovery 
- Cut winners at first profit signs 
- Overtrade during losing streaks 
The chapter covers: 
Berlin's Position Sizing Formula 
- Calculating risk per trade based on capital 
- Scaling position size during winning vs. losing streaks 
- The "profit cushion" concept that transforms psychology 


=== PAGE {} ===
The Drawdown Recovery Protocol 
- What Berlin did after losing ₹70 lakhs in 72 days 
- Recovering slowly rather than desperately 
- The 50% reduction rule during losing streaks 
The Profit Protection System 
- Withdrawing 20-30% of monthly profits 
- Creating separate "secured gains" accounts 
- Preventing the tragedy of giving everything back 
The Holding Discipline Framework 
- Staying in winners that run 100%+ 
- Partial profit booking strategy 
- Trailing stop loss techniques 
This section alone justifies the book's price. 
Because traders with perfect strategies blow up due to poor money management. And traders with 
mediocre strategies generate millions through brilliant money management. 
THE GREAT TRADES – Real Stories, Real Lessons 
Theory is important. But nothing teaches like real trades with real consequences. 
THE BALLS OF STEEL TRADE 
The complete documentation of Berlin's ₹10.75 lakh winning trade where: 
- His account showed ₹3.7L loss mid-trade 
- His brother called repeatedly during critical moments 
- His broker app crashed at the worst possible time 
- He still executed perfectly and exited profitably 
What you'll learn: 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Recognizing conviction despite temporary drawdowns 
- Testing market strength (Berlin exited 3.8L quantity to confirm buying demand) 
- Supply management with large positions 
- Why Berlin didn't blame anyone for the broker crash (acceptance and learning) 
This story will revolutionize how you view risk, conviction, and execution under extreme pressure. 
THE SMALL FISH STORY 
A parable about survival in the trading ocean: 
- How small fish (retail traders) must survive to grow 
- Why 90% of your cohort (traders who started with you) get eliminated 
- The hierarchy: small fish → big fish → bigger fish → whale (institutions) 
- How Berlin survived ₹70L losses by prioritizing foundation over fast profits 
- The day Berlin became the whale 
This story will reframe your entire journey from "get rich quick" to "survive long enough to 
become dangerous." 
BERLIN'S WISDOM – The Philosophy That Sustains You 
Trading is 90% psychology. Strategies are simple. Execution is hard because emotions interfere. 
Throughout the book, you'll discover Berlin's wisdom—lessons forged through pain, loss, 
recovery, and ultimately, triumph: 
"It's not about the lakhs you make in a day. It's about the lakhs you hold at the end of the year." 
"A small profit is always bigger than a big loss. Accepting mistakes and booking losses is the job 
of a wise man." 
"Never try to beat the market—market is always superior. Just cooperate with it. Give respect, 
take respect." 
"There is nothing you can't achieve. Believe in yourself. Everything you want is already in you." 
"Markets always prefer minority. If 90% think one way, think harder. Be the 10%." 


=== PAGE {} ===
"Cut losses short and let winners ride. This is the only way." 
These aren't motivational quotes. They're survival principles that kept Berlin alive when his 
account bled ₹1 lakh daily for 72 consecutive days. 
Internalize these, and you'll develop the psychological armor to survive anything markets throw at 
you. Why These Theories Are So Precious (And So Rare) Let me be direct about something most 
trading educators won't admit: Most trading strategies are repackaged public information. 
Someone learns about moving averages, adds a twist, creates a fancy name, and sells it as a 
"proprietary system." 
Berlin's theories are not that. 
Numerical Theory, Value Adjustment Theory, Adjustment Theory, and Big Money Theory are 
original frameworks developed through: 
 
10,000+ hours of screen time watching NSE derivatives markets 
 
Thousands of trades (winning and losing) that revealed patterns 
 
₹70 lakh in losses that taught what NOT to do 
 
₹2+ crore in profits that validated what DOES work 
 
Years of journaling to distill patterns into repeatable systems 
These aren't academic theories. They're battle-tested frameworks evolved from observing 
institutional order flow, expiry day mechanics, premium behavior, and the unique characteristics 
of Indian retail vs. institutional dynamics. 
You won't find Value Adjustment Theory on Investopedia. You won't find Big Money Theory in 
any course. You won't find Adjustment Theory discussed in trading forums. Because they're 
Berlin's. Developed by Berlin. Tested by Berlin. Profited from by Berlin. And now, documented 
for you. 
The Transformation You're About to Experience. Imagine waking up three months from now. You 
open your trading app. Your account is up 18% since finishing this book. You check yesterday's 
trades—three executed, two winners, one small loss. Net: +₹42,000. You're not excited (that's 
amateur energy). You're calm. Because this is now normal. 
You followed Berlin's rules. You applied Numerical Theory to a 3.2% gainer. You spotted a Value 
Adjustment opportunity on expiry day. You let your winner run to 87% instead of cutting at 20% 
like you used to. You log the trades. You review performance. You're on track for monthly targets. 
You check your "secured profits" account—the one Berlin insisted you create. It has ₹3.2 lakhs 
withdrawn over three months. Money no longer at risk. Money that's REAL. You're not wondering 
if trading works anymore. You know it works. Because you're doing it. This isn't fantasy. This is 
the destination this book guides you toward. 
But understand this: 


=== PAGE {} ===
That person—the calm, profitable, disciplined trader—exists inside you right now. They're just 
buried under: 
Bad habits (chasing, overtrading, revenge trading) 
Wrong beliefs ("I can't hold winners," "Stop losses are for losers") 
Missing frameworks (you didn't have Numerical Theory or Value Adjustment before) 
Weak psychology (you panic at red candles because you don't understand market structure) 
This book removes all of that. Layer by layer. Chapter by chapter. By the time you finish, you 
won't recognize your old trading self. 
The person who: 
 
Bought at tops out of FOMO 
 
Held losers hoping they'd recover 
 
Cut winners at 10% gain 
 
Overtrade to "make back" losses 
 
Followed tips from Telegram groups 
 
Had no plan, no rules, no edge 
That person dies somewhere around Chapter 1. 
By Chapter 9, you're reborn as a systematic, disciplined, edge-driven trader who knows exactly 
what they're doing and why. 
A Warning: This Book Will Test You. I need to be honest about something. This book will make 
you uncomfortable. Not because the content is difficult (though some sections require focus). But 
because it will expose every mistake you've been making and force you to confront them. When 
you read about money management and realize you've been risking 30% per trade instead of 2%—
that's uncomfortable. When you read about holding discipline and remember the ten trades where 
you cut winners at 15% that went to 100%—that's painful. When you read about Berlin's ₹70 lakh 
loss and his calm response while remembering your panic over ₹15,000—that's humbling. 
Good. 
Discomfort is growth. Pain is transformation. Humility is the first step to mastery. If you finish 
this book feeling comfortable, you didn't absorb it. You skimmed it. Readers who truly internalize 
this will feel: 
Excitement (these strategies work!) 
Regret (I've been doing everything wrong!) 


=== PAGE {} ===
Determination (I'm going to fix this!) 
Hope (I can actually succeed!) 
That cocktail of emotions? That's your signal that you're on the path to real change. 
The Contract: What I Ask of You 
Before you turn the page and begin this journey, make a commitment. 
Not to me. Not to Berlin. To yourself. 
I commit to: 
Read this book completely – Don't skip sections. Don't jump to strategies without reading the 
foundation. Every chapter builds on the previous. 
Take notes – Active learning. Journal key concepts. Write down rules. 
Practice before applying – Paper trade strategies for 20+ trades before going live. Simulation 
first, real money second. 
Follow rules without deviation – Don't modify Berlin's frameworks "to suit your style" in week 
one. Master them as taught, then adapt after six months. 
Track every trade – Journal entries, exits, emotions, learnings. Data doesn't lie. Memory does. 
Give it 6 months – Success isn't linear. You'll have losing weeks. Push through. The edge reveals 
itself over time. 
Be honest with yourself – If you break a rule and lose, don't blame the strategy. Take ownership. 
If you make this commitment: 
You will be a different trader—a better trader—a profitable trader—by the time you close this 
book. Not because of magic. Because of education, practice, and discipline. 
One Last Thing Before We Begin 
When Berlin lost ₹70 lakhs in 72 days, people thought he'd quit. His family worried. Friends 
suggested he "take a break." 
But Berlin knew something they didn't: Those 72 days weren't a failure. They were his MBA in 
trading. Every loss taught something: Which setups fail under certain conditions. How position 
sizing determines survival. Why emotional trading is suicide. Where institutional money enters 
and exits. How to stay calm when accounts bleed. That ₹70 lakh wasn't lost. It was invested in 


=== PAGE {} ===
education. And four months later, Berlin made ₹1.2 crores. Not by luck. Because his foundation—
built during those brutal 72 days—was now unshakable. You're about to receive that education 
without paying ₹70 lakhs. 
You're going to learn from Berlin's mistakes. Benefit from his discoveries. Apply his frameworks. 
That's not luck. That's the gift this book represents. Honor it by applying it. Welcome to Your 
Trading Transformation 
Turn the page. 
Your old trading life ends here. Your new one—disciplined, systematic, profitable—begins now. 
Let's begin something extraordinary. 
"The market doesn't reward hope. It rewards preparation. You're about to become prepared." — 
Berlin 
Now, take a deep breath. Quiet your mind. And begin Chapter 1: The 9% Club—Rules That 
Separate Profitable Traders From The Emotional Herd. 
Everything changes from here. 
The 9% club: Rules That Separate Profitable Traders From The Emotional Herd. 
As narrated by Berlin 
 
 


=== PAGE {} ===
The Rules, That Separate Profitable Traders From The 
Emotional Herd 
The Graduation Ceremony You Never Attended. Let me tell you about two traders who started on 
the same day with the same capital. 
Trader A (Rahul): 
- Starting capital: ₹10 lakhs 
- 6 months later: ₹3.2 lakhs 
- 12 months later: Out of the market 
 
Trader B (Priya): 
- Starting capital: ₹10 lakhs 
- 6 months later: ₹14.8 lakhs 
- 12 months later: ₹28.5 lakhs 
 
Same starting point. Same market. Same access to information. What separated them? Not 
intelligence. Not luck. Not capital. Rules. Discipline. Psychology. 
Priya belonged to the 9% club—the minority who consistently profit from derivatives trading in 
India. Rahul belonged to the 91% who lose money, blame the system, and eventually quit. 
Before you dive into the advanced theories—Numerical Theory, Value Adjustment Theory, 
Adjustment Theory, and Big Money Theory—you need to understand something fundamental: 
Those strategies are powerful weapons. But if you hand a rocket launcher to someone who can't 
follow basic safety protocols, they'll blow themselves up. This chapter is your foundation. Your 
graduation requirement before you touch the advanced material. These aren't just "tips." These are 
the non-negotiable rules that will determine whether you become Priya or Rahul. By the end of 
this chapter, you'll understand why 91% of traders fail and what the 9% do differently. More 
importantly, you'll have a checklist to ensure you're operating like the minority—the ones who 
win. Let's begin your transformation.

 RULE 1: Never Look For Reversals If The Market Is Going 
Up Continuously 
 The Story of Arjun's ₹2.4 Lakh Mistake. 
Arjun was watching Nifty on a Wednesday morning. The market opened at 24,850 and just kept 
climbing. 
24,900... 24,950... 25,000... 25,050... 
By 11:30 AM, Nifty was at 25,125—up 275 points. Strong, relentless buying. But Arjun's brain 
whispered: "This is too much. It has to reverse. Nothing goes up in a straight line." 
At 11:32 AM, he bought Nifty 25,100 PE at ₹45, expecting a pullback. The market didn't care 
about his expectation. 
25,150... 25,200... 25,250... 
By 1:00 PM, Nifty was at 25,280. His ₹45 put was now ₹12. Loss: ₹33 per option. On 200 contracts 
(4 lots), that's ₹6,600. But here's where it gets worse: Instead of accepting the loss, Arjun averaged 
down. "It HAS to reverse," he convinced himself. He bought another 200 contracts at ₹12. Nifty 
closed at 25,340. His puts expired at ₹2. Total loss: ₹2.4 lakhs in one day. 
 What Arjun Should Have Done 
In an uptrend, opportunities are found in DIPS, not at tops. 
When a market is in clear uptrend momentum: 
- Don't short the highs 
- Don't buy puts expecting reversal 
- Don't fight the trend 
Instead, wait for a dip (temporary pullback) and buy calls in the direction of the trend. 
If Nifty is rallying and pulls back from 25,250 to 25,180 (a 70-point dip), that's your entry—not 
when it's making new highs. 
 The 9% Club Approach. 
Profitable traders say: "The trend is my friend until the end." 
Losing traders say: "This looks toppy. I'll short it." 


=== PAGE {} ===
Guess who keeps their money? 
Practical Application: 
On a strong uptrend day: 
1. Identify the trend (higher highs, higher lows on 15-min/1-hour charts) 
2. Wait for a dip to previous support (yesterday's high, today's opening, key Fibonacci levels) 
3. Enter calls/long positions on the dip 
4. Stop loss below the dip low 
5. Ride the trend until it actually breaks structure 
Never fight a trend based on "feeling" that it should reverse. 
 
 RULE 2: Control Your Position Sizing If You Want To 
Survive 
 The Parable of the Three Traders. 
Three traders entered the market on the same Monday with ₹5 lakh capital each. 
Trader 1 (Aggressive Anil): 
- First trade: 50% of capital (₹2.5L) into Bank Nifty calls 
- Win: +₹75,000 
- Second trade: Emboldened, goes 70% (₹4L) into Nifty puts 
- Loss: -₹2.4L 
- Account after 2 trades: ₹3.1L (38% drawdown) 
 
Trader 2 (Conservative Priya): 
- First trade: 10% of capital (₹50K) into Bank Nifty calls 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Win: +₹15,000 
- Second trade: 10% (₹51.5K) into Nifty puts 
- Loss: -₹30,900 
- Account after 2 trades: ₹5.34L (7% gain) 
 
Trader 3 (Reckless Raj): 
- First trade: 100% into weekly OTM options 
- Loss: -₹4.2L (84% gone in one trade) 
- Game over. 
 
 The Mathematics of Survival. Here's the brutal truth about position sizing. If you lose 50% of 
your capital, you need a 100% return to break even. 
Let's break this down: 
- Starting capital: ₹10L 
- After 50% loss: ₹5L 
- To get back to ₹10L: You need ₹5L profit on ₹5L base = 100% return 
A 50% loss requires a 100% gain just to break even. But if you lose only 10%: 
- Starting capital: ₹10L 
- After 10% loss: ₹9L 
- To break even: You need ₹1L profit on ₹9L = 11.1% return 
Much more achievable. 
 The Berlin Position Sizing Formula for directional intraday trades: 
- Risk per trade: 2-3% of capital 
- Maximum positions: 3 concurrent trades 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Total capital at risk: Never more than 10% 
 
For scalping/high-frequency trades: 
- Risk per trade: 1-1.5% of capital 
- Maximum positions: 5 concurrent trades 
- Total capital at risk: Never more than 7% 
 
For expiry day strategies: 
- Risk per trade: 1.5-2.5% of capital 
- Maximum trades: 2 per session 
- Total capital at risk: Never more than 5% 
 
Example on ₹10 Lakh Capital: 
Intraday directional trade: 
- Risk: 2.5% = ₹25,000 
- If stop loss is 20% below entry, position size = ₹25,000 ÷ 0.20 = ₹1,25,000 
Even if you're wrong on 3 consecutive trades, you lose ₹75,000 (7.5%). Painful, but survivable. 
Control position sizing, or the market will control your survival. 
 
 RULE 3: 80-90% Of Monthly Expiries Expire Positive 
 The Statistical Edge Nobody Talks About 
This is one of the most underutilized insights in Indian options trading. I've tracked the last 5 years 
of Nifty monthly expiries (not weekly, but monthly). Here's what the data shows: 
Out of 60 monthly expiries: 


=== PAGE {} ===
- 52 closed positive (green) from opening to closing on expiry day 
- 8 closed negative (red) 
- Success rate: 86.7% 
 What This Means For You 
On monthly expiry day, if you're trading directionally: 
- Bias toward calls (long positions) statistically favors you 
- This doesn't mean blindly buy calls, but when setups align, favor bullish plays 
- Be cautious shorting/buying puts unless there's strong bearish momentum 
 The Caveat. This applies to monthly expiries, not weekly expiries. Weekly expiries are more 
volatile and don't show this pattern as clearly. But on the last Thursday of the month? The data 
suggests a bullish bias. Use this as confluence, not as your only reason to trade. If you have a 
bullish setup on monthly expiry + this statistical edge, your conviction should be higher. 
 RULE 4: If The Candle Has Rejected Support And Closed 
Positive, 85-90% Buying Trades Will Win 
 The Anatomy of a High-Probability Setup 
Let me paint a picture with an example. 
Nifty 1-hour chart: 
- Previous day low: 24,950 
- Opening: 25,010 
- At 10:15 AM, Nifty dips to 24,945 (15 points below previous day low) 
- Rejection: Price immediately shoots back up 
- 11:00 AM candle closes at 25,080 (green candle, fully recovered) 
This is a textbook high-probability buy setup. Why? Because: 
1. Support level (previous day low) was tested 
2. Price rejected below it (false breakdown) 


=== PAGE {} ===
3. Candle closed decisively positive (bulls in control) 
When this pattern forms, buying trades have an 85-90% success rate.  How To Trade This? 
Entry: After the candle closes positive above support. 
Stop Loss: Below the low of the rejection candle (24,945 in this case) 
Target: Previous high or 1-2% move 
Example: 
You enter Nifty 25,100 CE at ₹35 after the 11:00 AM rejection candle. 
- Stop loss: If Nifty breaks below 24,940 → exit at ₹28 (20% loss) 
- Target: ₹52 (50% gain) when Nifty reaches 25,200 
Risk: ₹7 per option 
Reward: ₹17 per option 
Risk-reward: 1:2.4 
With an 85% win rate and 1:2.4 RR, this is mathematical printing of money over time. The key is 
patience: Wait for the rejection and positive close. Don't anticipate it. 
 
 RULE 5: Don't Panic When You See Big Red Candles In A 
Strong Uptrend 
 The ₹4 Lakh Panic Exit That Cost Everything 
Rajesh was holding Nifty 25,000 CE with ₹1.2L invested. The trade was up ₹60,000 (50% gain). 
Then at 2:15 PM, a sudden 80-point red candle appeared. His premium dropped from ₹90 to ₹78 
in 3 minutes. Panic set in. "The trend is reversing! I need to exit!" He sold at ₹78. Locked in 
₹36,000 profit instead of ₹60,000. By 2:45 PM, Nifty had recovered fully. His premium was back 
at ₹92, then ₹105 by 3:00 PM. The dip got bought. Like it always does in strong uptrends. Had he 
held, his ₹1.2L would have become ₹2.1L. Instead, he exited at ₹1.56L. Cost of panic: ₹54,000. 
 The Dip-Buying Phenomenon: 
In strong uptrends, dips are bought aggressively by institutional players, algorithms, and smart 
retail traders. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Think about it logically: 
- If the trend is up and price dips, that's a discount 
- Buyers who missed earlier entries now get a chance 
- Smart money accumulates on dips, not at tops 
Red candles in uptrends are opportunities, not warnings. 
 How To Handle Dips Without Panic? Use Fibonacci retracement: When you're in a profitable 
long position: 
1. Mark the swing low to swing high on your chart 
2. Draw Fibonacci levels 
3. Your exit is only if price breaks below the 0.382 Fibonacci level 
Example: 
Nifty rallied from 24,900 (low) to 25,200 (high). 
- 0.382 level = 25,085 
As long as dips don't break below 25,085, the uptrend is intact. Hold your position. If 25,085 
breaks, then exit—the structure is damaged. But random red candles within the Fibonacci zone? 
Noise. Ignore. 
 RULE 6: When You've Lost 50% Of The Day's Profit, Exit 
The Market 
 The Slippery Slope of Giving Back Gains 
You start the day with ₹10L. 
By 12:30 PM, you're at ₹10.8L (+₹80,000 profit). Then a trade goes wrong. ₹10.5L. Another trade. 
₹10.35L. You're still up ₹35,000 for the day. Not bad, right? 
Wrong. 
You've given back ₹45,000 (56% of your peak profit). At this point, psychology kicks in. You feel 
like you're "losing" even though you're technically still positive. This emotional state leads to: 
- Revenge trading 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Overtrading 
- Reckless position sizing 
And by 3:00 PM, you're at ₹9.7L—negative for the day. 
 The 50% Rule 
Berlin's Rule: If you lose 50% of your day's peak profit, stop trading immediately. 
In the example above: 
- Peak profit: ₹80,000 
- 50% threshold: ₹40,000 loss from peak 
- Trigger point: When you drop from ₹10.8L to ₹10.4L → STOP 
Walk away. Close the laptop. The market will be there tomorrow. 
Why this works? 
It prevents the emotional spiral that turns winning days into losing days. You lock in at least half 
your gains and live to trade another day with a clear mind. The market doesn't reward stubbornness. 
It rewards discipline. 
 RULE 7: Never Try To Beat The Market—Cooperate With 
It 
 The Ego That Costs ₹10 Lakhs 
Suresh was convinced Nifty would crash. His analysis, his indicators, his "gut feeling" all pointed 
down. Nifty, however, disagreed. It kept climbing. But Suresh's ego wouldn't let him adapt. "The 
market is wrong. I'm right. It WILL fall." He kept shorting, kept buying puts, kept fighting. Five 
days later, his ₹10L account was ₹6.2L. The market wasn't wrong. His ego was. The Give Respect, 
Take Respect Principle. The market is infinitely bigger than you. It doesn't care about your 
analysis, your predictions, or your ego. Your job isn't to prove the market wrong. Your job is to 
read what it's doing and align with it. When the market says "up," you go long. When the market 
says "down," you go short. When the market says "choppy consolidation," you stay out. It's that 
simple. 
 How To Practice Cooperation 
1. Follow price action, not predictions 


=== PAGE {} ===
   - If your analysis says down but price keeps making higher highs → you're wrong, adapt 
2. Respect strong momentum 
   - Don't fade moves, join them 
3. Accept when you're wrong 
   - Wrong analysis + ego = catastrophic loss 
   - Wrong analysis + humility = small loss + repositioning 
The market will always be superior. Trade accordingly. 
 RULE 8: If The Stock/Index Closed With A Complete 
Green/Red Candle In Daily TF, It Will Follow The Same 
Direction Next Day 
 The Continuation Pattern Edge 
This is pure statistical pattern recognition. 
When a daily candle closes completely green (close near the high) or completely red (close near 
the low), it signals strong momentum continuation. 
Example: 
Monday: Nifty daily candle 
- Open: 24,850 
- High: 25,120 
- Low: 24,840 
- Close: 25,115 
This is a strong bullish candle (closed near high, minimal lower wick). 
Tuesday's bias: Bullish continuation. 
Statistically, 70-75% of the time, Tuesday will follow Monday's direction in the first half of the 
session. 
 How To Trade This? 


=== PAGE {} ===
On Tuesday morning: 
- If Monday closed with a strong green candle → bias toward calls/long trades 
- If Monday closed with a strong red candle → bias toward puts/short trades 
Entry: Wait for the first 15-30 minutes (avoid opening volatility), then enter in the direction of 
Monday's close. Stop loss: Below Monday's low (for bullish setup) or above Monday's high (for 
bearish setup). This is not a guarantee, but a statistical edge. Use it as confirmation for other setups, 
not in isolation. 
 RULE 9: If Your Thinking Matches 90% Of People, Think 
Harder 
 The Tyranny of the Majority 
Here's a market truth that sounds cruel but is mathematically necessary. For 10% of traders to 
make money, 90% must lose money. Money doesn't appear out of thin air. It's transferred. From 
the many to the few. So when 90% of people are thinking one way, the market will usually do the 
opposite. 
 The Retail Trap Example 
Friday, 2:30 PM. Bank Nifty has been falling all day. 
Telegram groups are buzzing: 
"Bank Nifty will crash to 47,500." 
"Buying 48,000 PE." 
"This is going to 47,000 by close." 
Sentiment is overwhelmingly bearish. 90% of retail is short. What happens? 
At 2:45 PM, Bank Nifty suddenly reverses. Rallies 300 points in 30 minutes. Closes at 48,450. All 
those puts? Worthless. The 90% got crushed. The 10% who stayed out or went long against the 
crowd made money. 
 How To Think Like The 10% 
Ask yourself before every trade: 
- What is the obvious trade everyone is talking about? 


=== PAGE {} ===
- What would hurt the maximum number of people? 
- What move would surprise 90% of traders? 
Then consider positioning for that. This doesn't mean blindly contrarian. It means: 
- Be cautious when everyone agrees 
- Be aggressive when you see an opportunity others are ignoring 
- Question consensus, always 
The crowd is usually wrong at turning points. Be the exception. 
 
 RULE 10: Buying And Execution Is Easy—Control Yourself 
While In The Trade 
 The Three-Phase Trader Journey 
Phase 1: Learning to enter 
- Most beginners obsess over this 
- "Which strike? When to buy? What indicator?" 
 
Phase 2: Learning to exit 
- This is where intermediates struggle 
- "When to book profit? When to cut loss?" 
 
Phase 3: Learning to hold 
- This is where professionals dominate 
- "How to stay in winning trades? How to not panic in drawdowns?" 
 


=== PAGE {} ===
Most traders never reach Phase 3. 
 The Holding Problem. 
You buy Nifty 25,000 CE at ₹40. Your target is ₹80 (100% gain). Within 10 minutes, it's at ₹48 
(+20%). Your brain screams: "Book it! ₹20,000 profit! Don't be greedy!" You exit at ₹48. By 2:00 
PM, it's at ₹92. You left ₹130,000 on the table because you couldn't hold. 
 The Berlin Holding Framework 
Step 1: Plan before entry 
- Entry: ₹40 
- Stop loss: ₹32 
- Target 1 (50%): ₹60 
- Target 2 (100%): ₹80 
- Target 3 (150%): ₹100 
Step 2: Execute mechanically 
- At ₹60 → Book 30% of position 
- At ₹80 → Book another 40% of position 
- Remaining 30% → Hold with trailing stop at ₹70 
Step 3: Don't deviate 
- Don't exit at ₹48 just because you're nervous 
- Don't hold past ₹32 stop loss hoping for recovery 
- Follow. The. Plan. 
This is the difference between traders who make ₹50,000/month and ₹5,00,000/month. Same 
strategies. Different execution discipline. 
 
 RULE 11: In An Uptrend Market, A Dip To Previous Day 
Low Is A Golden Opportunity 


=== PAGE {} ===
 The Support-Turned-Resistance-Turned-Support Principle 
Previous day levels are magnets. 
When today's price dips to yesterday's low in an uptrend market, it's testing support. If that support 
holds, you have a high-probability long setup. 
Example: 
Tuesday: Nifty low: 24,920. Nifty close: 25,080 
Wednesday: Opening: 25,050. 11:15 AM: Dips to 24,930 (testing Tuesday's low) 
- Bounces to 24,960 within minutes 
This is your entry. 
Trade setup: 
- Enter calls at ₹40 when bounce confirms 
- Stop loss: Break of 24,920 (Tuesday's low) 
- Target: 25,120 (Tuesday's high) 
Risk: 40 points below 24,960 = ₹25 stop loss premium 
Reward: 160 points to target = ₹75+ profit premium 
Risk-reward: 1:3+ 
 The Add-On Strategy 
Berlin's advanced technique: When you get the bounce from previous day low, start with 50% of 
your planned position. If price confirms strength (moves 20-30 points above the low), add the 
remaining 50%. This "scaling in" approach reduces risk if the support fails while maximizing 
returns if it holds. 
 RULE 12: Market Always Fills Gaps (Eventually) 
 The Gap Psychology 
A gap is when today's opening price is significantly different from yesterday's close. 
Gap-up: Today opens above yesterday's close  


=== PAGE {} ===
Gap-down: Today opens below yesterday's close 
Statistical reality: 80-85% of gaps get filled within 1-5 trading sessions. 
Example: 
Monday close: 25,050  
Tuesday open: 25,180 (130-point gap-up) 
This creates a "gap zone" between 25,050-25,180. 
Strategy: If Tuesday continues higher to 25,300, watch for a pullback. When price enters the gap 
zone (say, 25,150), that's often a good level to buy, expecting the gap to fill completely toward 
25,050. But be careful: Don't fight strong momentum just to trade gap fills. Wait for signs of 
exhaustion first. The market will fill gaps, but on its own timeline—not yours. 
 
 RULE 13: Respect The Trend If You Want To Survive 
 The Trend Is Not Just Your Friend—It's Your Boss 
I cannot overstate this enough. More traders blow up fighting trends than from any other single 
mistake. 
 The Three Trend Rules 
Rule 1: In an uptrend, only look for long opportunities. Don't short. 
Rule 2: In a downtrend, only look for short opportunities. Don't buy. 
Rule 3: In a sideways/choppy market, reduce position size or stay out. 
It's that simple. 
 How To Identify The Trend? 
Use multiple timeframes: 
Daily chart: Determines overall bias 
- Higher highs + higher lows = Uptrend 
- Lower highs + lower lows = Downtrend 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Neither = Sideways 
1-hour chart: Determines intraday structure 
- Aligns with daily? Strong trend. 
- Conflicts with daily? Possible reversal or correction. 
 
15-minute chart: Determines entry timing 
- Pullbacks in uptrend = buy 
- Rallies in downtrend = sell 
Don't trade against the daily trend based on 15-minute chart patterns. That's suicide. 
RULE 14: Buying & Execution Is Easy—Plan, Execute, Stop 
Loss/Target, Exit 
The Four-Step Trading Process 
This is your mantra. Repeat it before every trade. 
Step 1: PLAN 
What am I trading? Why am I trading it? What's my entry price? What's my stop loss? What's my 
target? What's my position size? 
Step 2: EXECUTE 
Enter at the planned price. Set stop loss immediately. Set target (or alerts) 
Step 3: MANAGE 
Let the trade play out. Don't micromanage. Honor stop loss if hit. Book profits at target 
Step 4: EXIT 
Either stop loss or target gets hit. Close the position. Log the trade. Move on. No emotions. No 
deviations. Mechanical execution. This process turns trading from gambling into a business. 
RULE 15: Markets Prefer Minority—Choice Is Yours 


=== PAGE {} ===
The 2/10 vs. 8/10 Paradigm 
Berlin's observation: 
Majority traders (90%): Win 2 out of 10 trades decisively 
Minority traders (10%): Win 8 out of 10 trades decisively 
Why? 
Because the majority: 
Chases trends after they're exhausted 
Panics out of good trades early 
Holds losing trades too long 
Overtrades 
Follows tips blindly 
The minority: 
Waits for high-probability setups 
Holds winners patiently 
Cuts losers ruthlessly 
Trades selectively 
Thinks independently 
Same market. Different approaches. Opposite results. 
How To Join The Minority 
It's not about being smarter. It's about being disciplined. 
Majority behavior: 
See a big green candle → FOMO buy at the top 
See a red candle in profit → panic sell 


=== PAGE {} ===
See others making money → overtrade to catch up 
Minority behavior: 
See a big green candle → wait for pullback 
See a red candle in profit → check if structure is broken before exiting 
See others making money → stick to their own plan 
You choose which group you belong to with every decision. 
RULE 16: Without Risk, You Can't Keep Your Goals Big 
The Paradox of Safety 
Every new trader wants to find the "safe" strategy—the one with no risk. It doesn't exist. 
Zero risk = Zero reward. 
The goal isn't to eliminate risk. It's to manage risk intelligently. 
Berlin's advice: Always take risks, but know your appetite. 
Conservative risk appetite: 
Risk 1% per trade 
Target 2-3% return 
Slow, steady compounding 
Moderate risk appetite: 
Risk 2-3% per trade 
Target 5-8% return 
Balanced growth 
Aggressive risk appetite: 
Risk 4-5% per trade 
Target 10-15% return 


=== PAGE {} ===
High volatility, high returns 
The key: Whatever appetite you choose, stick to it. Don't switch between conservative and 
aggressive based on emotions. 
Berlin says: "One day will come which will make you countrywide big or bigger. But the key is, 
you should be on your own rules." 
That one trade—the ₹10L profit, the ₹50L gain—comes when: 
You've built capital through consistent small wins. You recognize a once-in-a-month setup. You 
have the capital and psychology to size appropriately. You honor your rules even under pressure. 
But you'll never survive to see that trade if you don't manage risk on the 99 trades before it. 
RULE 17: Don't Ever Trade With Your Thinking—Follow 
The Price 
The Prediction Trap 
Your analysis says Nifty should fall. Price keeps going up. Question: Who's wrong—you or the 
market? 
Answer: You are. Always. 
Price Is Truth. Price action is the market's collective vote. It's millions of participants with billions 
in capital expressing their view. Your analysis? It's one person's opinion based on limited 
information. When price conflicts with your analysis, follow price. Your analysis is outdated. 
How To Follow Price? 
Instead of: "I think Nifty will fall, so I'll buy puts." 
Do this: "Nifty is making higher highs. My analysis said down, but price says up. I'll either go long 
or stay out." Price is the ultimate arbiter. It doesn't matter what you think should happen. It matters 
what is happening. 
RULE 18: If Markets Open With A Big Gap, The Side With 
Premium Cuts Continues To Lose 
The Gap Opening Premium Decay 
This is an expiry day phenomenon. 
Example: 


=== PAGE {} ===
Nifty opens gap-up at 25,200 (previous close: 25,000). 
Option premiums at 9:15 AM: 
25,200 CE: ₹60 (ATM) 
25,200 PE: ₹18 (ATM) 
If Nifty stays flat around 25,200 for the next hour: 
25,200 CE will decay: ₹60 → ₹48 → ₹38 
25,200 PE will decay: ₹18 → ₹12 → ₹8 
Both sides lose, but the puts lose more dramatically. 
Trading The Gap 
Don't buy options immediately after a big gap. 
Wait 15-30 minutes. Let the initial volatility settle. Then assess: 
Is the gap holding? (Continuation likely) 
Is the gap filling? (Reversal likely) 
Only then take a position. 
Buying into the gap open without confirmation is gambling on direction with guaranteed theta 
decay working against you. 
RULE 19: If Your Trade Stays At The Same Place For 15-20 
Minutes, Book Profit/Loss 
The Stagnation Signal 
When price action goes dead—premium not moving, spot not moving—it's a warning sign. 
Why? 
Because in derivatives, time is money. Every minute you hold an option, theta is decaying. If 
you're not gaining ground after 15-20 minutes, you're losing ground (due to decay). 
The Action Rule: 


=== PAGE {} ===
If in profit: Book it. The momentum isn't there. 
If at entry: Exit. The setup isn't playing out. 
If at small loss: Cut it. Don't let theta turn small loss into big loss. 
Exception: Expiry day final 30 minutes, where premiums can explode in seconds. Otherwise, 
stagnation = exit signal. 
RULE 20: Never Fight With The Trade—Follow Price, Place 
SL/Target 
The Predictability Disease 
The number one psychological trap: 
"I know it will bounce from here." 
"It HAS to reach my target." 
"Just a little more time..." 
You don't know. Nobody knows. The Process, Not The Outcome. 
Your job: 
Identify a high-probability setup. Enter with defined risk. Let the market decide. 
Your job is NOT: 
To predict exactly where price will go. To force the market to hit your target. To hold beyond stop 
loss hoping for recovery. Set your stop loss. Set your target. Let price decide which gets hit first. 
That's it. When you trade the process instead of the outcome, losses don't hurt your ego. They're 
just feedback. 
RULE 21: When Market Gives You Easy Money, Be Extra 
Cautious 
The Calm Before The Storm 
The scariest trading days aren't the volatile red days. They're the days when everything works. 
Every trade is green. Every setup triggers. You make ₹80,000 by 12 PM. That's when you should 
be most cautious. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Why? Because when the market is that easy, it's usually luring in maximum participants before a 
sharp reversal. 
The Berlin Response 
On days when profits come too easily: 
Reduce position sizing for remaining trades. Book profits more aggressively (don't get greedy). 
Consider stopping early (secure the gains). Expect volatility to spike soon. Easy money is 
borrowed from future volatility. Protect it. 
RULE 22: Don't Try To Catch Tops & Bottoms In Trending 
Markets 
The Ego Of Perfection 
Every trader dreams of shorting the exact top and buying the exact bottom. 
Reality: You'll miss both 95% of the time and lose money trying. 
 The Smarter Approach: 
In uptrends: Don't try to short the top. Trade pullbacks for continuation. 
In downtrends: Don't try to catch the bottom. Trade rallies for continuation shorts. 
Let someone else have the first 10% and the last 10%. You take the safe, profitable middle 80%. 
 Example: The Nifty Rally 
Nifty rallies from 24,800 to 25,400 over three days. 
The perfectionist trader: 
- Waits to short at 25,400 (the top) 
- Misses it, watches it go to 25,450 
- Shorts at 25,450 
- Gets stopped out at 25,520 
- Loss: ₹70 points trying to catch the top 
 


=== PAGE {} ===
The professional trader: 
- Watches the rally without envy 
- When Nifty pulls back to 25,200, buys calls 
- Rides continuation to 25,380 
- Exits with ₹180 points 
- Profit: Didn't need the top, just the middle 
Focus on probability, not perfection. The middle of the trend is where the money is. The edges are 
where egos get hurt. 
 RULE 23: Keep Tracking The Strength Of The Day—Loss 
Of Momentum Causes Loss 
 The Momentum Decay Pattern 
Intraday momentum is like a wave. It builds, peaks, and fades. 
Typical intraday momentum cycle: 
9:15 AM - 10:30 AM: Opening momentum (usually directional)  
10:30 AM - 12:00 PM: First consolidation (momentum fades)  
12:00 PM - 1:30 PM: Midday drift (lowest momentum)  
1:30 PM - 2:30 PM: Afternoon revival (momentum returns)  
2:30 PM - 3:30 PM: Closing scramble (highest volatility) 
 Trading By Momentum Phases: 
High momentum phases (9:15-10:30 AM, 2:30-3:30 PM): 
- Larger position sizes 
- Wider targets 
- Aggressive entries 
 


=== PAGE {} ===
Low momentum phases (10:30 AM-1:30 PM): 
- Smaller positions 
- Tighter targets 
- Conservative entries or stay out 
Example: 
You enter a call at 9:45 AM during strong momentum. Premium moves from ₹40 to ₹65 by 10:15 
AM. 
At 10:30 AM, momentum stalls. Price goes sideways. 
Don't hold expecting the same momentum to resume. Book profits and reassess. Loss of 
momentum = Loss of opportunity = Eventual loss of capital if you hold. Momentum is oxygen for 
intraday trades. When it disappears, your trade is suffocating. 
 RULE 24: Understanding The Flow And Cycle Is Very 
Important 
 The Market's Four Seasons 
Every trader goes through cycles. The market goes through cycles. Understanding this prevents 
emotional decisions. 
Cycle 1: Accumulation (Learning Phase) 
- You're learning, testing, losing small amounts 
- Capital stays relatively flat 
- Frustration builds 
- Action: Focus on process, not profits 
 
Cycle 2: Expansion (Winning Streak) 
- Strategies start working 
- Capital grows 20-30% 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Confidence soars 
- Warning: This is when overconfidence creeps in 
 
Cycle 3: Distribution (Giving Back Phase) 
- Losses start occurring 
- You give back 30-50% of recent gains 
- Frustration returns 
- Action: Reduce position sizing, review mistakes 
 
Cycle 4: Contraction (Losing Streak) 
- Multiple losses in a row 
- Capital drops below starting point 
- Despair and doubt dominate 
- Action: STOP trading, rebuild psychology 
 
 The Berlin Wisdom 
"Everything happens for a reason. Know the cause behind your loss." 
When you're in a losing streak: 
- Don't focus on things that don't work 
- Focus on what historically works for you 
- Accept mistakes by taking the loss quickly 
- Don't trade in hope—trade in probability 


=== PAGE {} ===
A smaller loss early stops a bigger loss later. By the time you commit a big loss, you've already 
ignored five warning signs (smaller losses you didn't cut). Each cycle teaches you something. 
Respect the cycle. 
 RULE 25: Options Analysis Should Come First—Know The 
Option Before You Trade It 
 The Deadly Assumption 
Most traders do this: 
1. Look at Nifty chart 
2. Decide direction (bullish) 
3. Buy a random call option 
4. Hope for profit 
They skip the most critical step: analyzing the option itself. 
 The Six Questions Before Entry: 
Question 1: What's the premium? 
- ₹5 or ₹50 makes a huge difference in risk and reward 
Question 2: What's the time to expiry? 
- 1 day vs. 7 days = different theta decay 
Question 3: What's the implied volatility (IV)? 
- High IV = expensive premium = lower returns even if direction is right 
- Low IV = cheap premium = higher returns 
Question 4: What's the delta? 
- 0.30 delta means premium moves ₹30 for every ₹100 spot movement 
- 0.70 delta means ₹70 movement 
Question 5: What's the open interest? 


=== PAGE {} ===
- High OI = liquid = easy exit 
- Low OI = illiquid = stuck position risk 
Question 6: What's the risk-reward? 
- If risking ₹10 to make ₹15, that's 1:1.5 RR 
- If risking ₹10 to make ₹50, that's 1:5 RR 
 Example: The Wrong Call Selection 
Scenario: Nifty at 25,000. You're bullish. 
Option A: 25,500 CE (far OTM) 
- Premium: ₹8 
- Delta: 0.15 
- For ₹100 Nifty move, premium gains ₹15 
Option B: 25,100 CE (slightly OTM) 
- Premium: ₹45 
- Delta: 0.45 
- For ₹100 Nifty move, premium gains ₹45 
Both are calls. Both profit if Nifty goes up. But Option B is 3x more effective. 
If Nifty rallies 150 points to 25,150: 
- Option A: ₹8 → ₹22 (175% gain but requires massive move) 
- Option B: ₹45 → ₹112 (149% gain with moderate move) 
Know your option. Not just the direction. 
 RULE 26: There's No Use Predicting A 1000-Point Fall If 
You Can't Hold An Option For 100 Points 
 The Prediction vs. Execution Gap 


=== PAGE {} ===
The amateur trader: 
"Nifty is going to crash 1000 points! I'm buying puts!" Buys puts. Nifty drops 80 points. Premium 
gains ₹25. Amateur gets nervous. "What if it reverses?" Exits. Locks ₹25 profit. Nifty drops 
another 400 points that day. His puts would be up ₹280. He was right about direction but made 
10% of the potential profit due to poor holding discipline. 
The Execution Reality: 
Being right about direction is 20% of trading. 
Execution—entry, holding, exit—is 80%. 
You can predict a 500-point rally perfectly, but if you: 
- Enter at a bad price (high IV) 
- Exit at the first sign of profit (₹30 gain) 
- Or panic out on a 20-point pullback 
You'll make ₹5,000 instead of ₹50,000. 
 Berlin's Solution: 
Before entering any trade, declare: 
"I predict [X] will move [Y] points. I am willing to hold through [Z] point drawdown. My target 
is [W] profit percentage." 
Then honor it. If you can't hold for your declared target, don't enter the trade at all. Your prediction 
is worthless if your execution is weak. 
 RULE 27: A Small Profit Is Always Bigger Than A Big Loss 
 The Mathematics of Survival 
Scenario A: 
- 8 trades with small profits (₹8K, ₹10K, ₹12K, ₹9K, ₹11K, ₹7K, ₹13K, ₹10K) 
- Total: ₹80,000 
Scenario B: 
- 1 trade with big loss: -₹75,000 


=== PAGE {} ===
Net after 9 trades: +₹5,000 
Now imagine if that big loss was avoided: 
Without big loss: +₹80,000 
One big loss wiped out the gains from 8 successful trades. 
 The Wise Man vs. The Fool 
Berlin says: 
"Accepting mistakes and booking losses is the job of a wise man. Holding them and fighting the 
market is the job of a fool." 
Wise trader: 
- Sees trade going wrong → exits at -₹8,000 loss 
- Lives to trade another day 
- Recovers with next winning trade 
Foolish trader: 
- Sees trade going wrong → "It will come back" 
- -₹8,000 becomes -₹25,000 
- Panic sets in 
- Finally exits at -₹60,000 
- Account destroyed 
 
 The Berlin Principle: "Losses get double in intraday very quickly." 
In options trading, due to leverage and theta decay, a ₹10,000 loss can become ₹25,000 in 30 
minutes if you don't cut it. 
You should always know when to stop and get out. Small profits accumulate into big wealth.  Big 
losses destroy everything instantly. Choose wisely. 
 


=== PAGE {} ===
 RULE 28: Put Profits In A Separate Account—You'll Thank 
Me Later 
 The Profit Cushion Strategy 
Through weeks, months, years—whatever money you make, put some percentage into a savings 
or emergency account. Berlin recommends: 20-30% of every profitable month. 
Example: 
Month 1: Profit ₹80,000 → Transfer ₹20,000 to savings  
Month 2: Profit ₹1,20,000 → Transfer ₹30,000 to savings  
Month 3: Loss -₹40,000 → No transfer 
After 12 months of this discipline: 
- Total profits: ₹8,00,000 
- Transferred to savings: ₹2,00,000 
- Still in trading account: ₹6,00,000 
 Why This Matters? 
Psychological benefit: You're trading with "profits," not your "capital." This reduces emotional 
pressure. 
Financial security: Even if you have a catastrophic losing streak, you have ₹2,00,000 secured. 
Prevents giving it all back: The biggest tragedy in trading is making ₹10 lakhs, then losing ₹12 
lakhs, ending negative. 
By withdrawing regularly, you lock in real gains. 
 The Berlin Guarantee: "Do this without questioning, and I know you will thank me later." 
Because five years from now, that separate account will have ₹40-50 lakhs while you're still 
actively trading with your main account. That's wealth. That's freedom. 
 


=== PAGE {} ===
 RULE 29: A Big Loss Can't Be Covered In The Next Day—
Learn From The Market 
 The Market's Recovery Pattern 
When Nifty falls 1000 points in one day, does it rise 1000 points the next day? 
No. 
It recovers slowly. Maybe 200 points the next day. Then 150. Then 180. Over 7-10 days, it recovers 
the 1000-point loss. 
Your account should recover the same way. 
 The Revenge Trading Trap: 
Trader loses ₹50,000 on Monday. Tuesday morning: "I need to make back ₹50K today!" Increases 
position sizing. Takes risky trades. Overtrades. 
Result: Another ₹40,000 loss. Now down ₹90,000 total, the hole keeps getting deeper. 
 The Berlin Recovery Protocol 
After a big loss: 
Day 1 after loss: Don't trade. Review what went wrong. Journal it. 
Day 2-7: Trade with 50% of normal position size. Focus on consistency, not recovery. 
Week 2: If back to profitable, gradually return to normal size. 
Recover the comfort of a 1-day loss over 10 days of discipline. 
Slow and steady recovery is sustainable. Desperate quick recovery destroys accounts. 
 
 RULE 30: Never Overtrade In A Losing Streak—Reduce 
Position Size By 50% 
 The Losing Streak Vortex 
Losing streaks create a psychological spiral: 


=== PAGE {} ===
Loss 1: "Bad luck, I'll get the next one."  
Loss 2: "Okay, two losses, but I'm due for a win."  
Loss 3: "I NEED to win now. I'll increase size."  
This is where accounts die. The Devil Version Of Yourself. 
Berlin warns: 
"Never overtrade in a losing streak. The moment you do, you'll become a devil version of yourself, 
and that devil can destroy everything you have." 
When you're losing: 
- Your judgment is compromised 
- Your risk tolerance is distorted 
- Your patience evaporates 
You make emotional decisions disguised as calculated trades. 
 The Berlin Losing Streak Protocol 
During a losing streak: 
1. Reduce position size to 50% of normal 
   - If you normally risk ₹25K per trade, risk ₹12.5K 
2. Limit trades to maximum 1 per day 
   - Quality over quantity 
3. Consider taking 2-3 days off 
   - Sometimes not trading is the most profitable decision 
4. Use the time and saved capital for life 
   - Travel, family time, mental reset 
5. Return only when you have three consecutive paper trades that would have been profitable 
During a winning streak: 


=== PAGE {} ===
1. Increase position sizing gradually 
   - If you normally risk ₹25K, increase to ₹30K (not ₹50K) 
2. Take partial profits more aggressively 
   - Secure gains before volatility takes them back 
3. Stay humble 
   - Winning streaks end. Don't get overconfident. 
 The Time Recognition: "There's a time where you should trade and there's a time where you 
should not trade." Sometimes not trading IS a profitable day. 
You save capital. You save mental energy. You preserve your psychological edge. The market will 
always be there. Your capital and sanity might not be if you force trades during losing streaks. 
 RULE 31: Look For Big Opportunities When Market Breaks 
Weekly/Monthly Lows 
 The Structural Break Setup 
When price breaks significant support levels—especially weekly or monthly lows—it often 
triggers: 
- Stop loss cascades 
- Panic selling 
- Momentum acceleration 
This creates explosive opportunities. 
 Example: The Monthly Low Break 
Nifty monthly low (set 4 weeks ago): 24,650 
Current price: 24,680 (hovering just above monthly low) 
If 24,650 breaks: 
- Stops get triggered 
- Selling accelerates 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Puts explode in value 
Setup: 
- Wait for decisive break (close below 24,650) 
- Enter puts on retest of broken support (now resistance) 
- Target: Previous major support level (maybe 24,400) 
- Stop loss: Reclaim above 24,650 
Risk-reward on structural breaks is often 1:3 or better. 
 For beginners, Berlin recommends using Fibonacci retracement: 
After a structural break: 
1. Mark the high before the break to the breaking point 
2. Enter short positions at 0.382 or 0.5 retracement 
3. Stop loss just above 0.618 
4. Target: Extension levels (1.272, 1.618) 
Fibonacci removes guesswork and provides mechanical entry/exit levels. 
 
 RULE 32: Money Management Is The Key To Profitability 
 The 20-80 Reality 
Berlin repeats this constantly: "20% strategy, 80% money management." 
You can have the best strategy in the world, but without proper money management: 
- You'll overtrade winners into losers 
- You'll hold losers until they're catastrophic 
- You'll size positions emotionally 
- You'll blow up eventually 


=== PAGE {} ===
 The Profit Cushion Concept: 
One of Berlin's most powerful concepts: Trade with a profit cushion. 
What does this mean? 
Once you've grown your ₹5L account to ₹6L, you're now trading with ₹1L in profits. This changes 
your psychology. You're no longer afraid of risking your "hard-earned capital." You're risking "the 
market's money." 
This psychological shift allows you to: 
- Hold winners longer (less fear) 
- Take calculated risks (less emotional attachment) 
- Think clearly (reduced pressure) 
 Position Sizing By Account Phase 
Phase 1: Building (₹5L-₹10L): 
- Risk: 1.5-2% per trade 
- Conservative 
Phase 2: Growing (₹10L-₹25L): 
- Risk: 2-2.5% per trade 
- Moderate 
Phase 3: Scaling (₹25L+): 
- Risk: 2-3% per trade 
- Still controlled, but compounding accelerates 
At every phase, money management protects your progress. 
 
 RULE 33: Don't Be a Coward—Hold Your Trades Either To 
SL Or Target 


=== PAGE {} ===
 The Coward's Exit 
You enter a trade with a plan: 
- Entry: ₹50 
- Stop loss: ₹40 
- Target: ₹80 
Price moves to ₹62. 
You see a small red candle. You panic. You exit at ₹60. 
Profit: ₹10 per option. 
Price then moves to ₹85. 
Missed profit: ₹35 per option. 
 The Courage To Follow Your Plan 
Berlin's message: "If you have executed a trade, hold it either till SL or target. Not holding trades 
when the market moves in your direction is what cowards do." 
Why "coward"? Because you had the courage to enter (risking capital), but not the courage to hold 
(potentially gaining reward). You're willing to risk but not willing to win big. 
 The Discipline Solution 
Before entering any trade: 
1. Set stop loss in your trading platform (GTT/OCO order) 
2. Set target alert or sell order 
3. Close the screen or minimize the app 
4. Let the market decide 
Don't watch every tick. Don't second-guess. Don't exit prematurely. Be brave enough to let your 
winners run. The market rewards courage with compounding. It punishes cowardice with 
mediocrity. 


=== PAGE {} ===
 RULE 34: Last Day's Market Closing Plays A Very 
Important Role As Support 
 The Closing Price Magnet 
Yesterday's closing price has gravitational pull. 
Why? Because: 
- Institutional orders are often anchored to previous close 
- Algorithms use previous close as reference 
- Retail psychology sees it as "fair value" 
When today's price dips to yesterday's close, it often bounces. 
 Trading The Close. 
Example: 
Wednesday close: 25,080  
Thursday opening: 25,150  
At 11:00 AM: Dips to 25,085 
This is a high-probability long setup. The market is testing yesterday's close. If it holds, 
continuation likely. 
Entry: Calls when price confirms bounce (say, 25,090)  
Stop loss: Break of 25,075  
Target: Yesterday's high or today's opening high 
Risk: 15 points  
Reward: 60-80 points  
RR: 1:4+ 
 The Swing Opportunities 
Berlin notes: "Look to make small trades at swing points." 


=== PAGE {} ===
These swing points include: 
- Yesterday's close 
- Previous day high/low 
- Opening levels 
- Major round numbers (25,000, 25,500) 
Small, high-probability trades at these levels compound into significant monthly gains. 
 
 RULE 35: Timeframes Matter—Use The Right One For 
Your Style 
 Berlin's Timeframe Arsenal 
1 minute: For scalping (5-15 point targets)  
3 minute: For aggressive scalps (15-30 point targets)  
5 minute: For day trades (50-80 point targets)  
15 minute: For day trades with fewer trades (80-120 point targets)  
1 hour: For strong momentum & price action (100-200 point targets)  
1 day: For strength, bias, and overall trend determination 
 The Mistake: Trading 1-Minute Charts For Swing Trades 
Beginners often: 
- Look at 1-minute charts 
- See random noise 
- Take trades based on 3-candle patterns 
- Get stopped out 10 times 
- Blame the market 


=== PAGE {} ===
The problem: They're using the wrong timeframe for their style. 
 Matching Timeframe To Strategy: 
If you're scalping: 1-3 minute charts + tight stops  
If you're day trading: 5-15 minute charts + moderate stops  
If you're swing trading: 1-hour + daily charts + wider stops 
Don't day trade off 1-minute charts. Don't scalp off 1-hour charts. 
Match your timeframe to your holding period. 
 
 RULE 36: Look For Overvalued & Undervalued Options On 
Expiry 
 The Value Dislocation Opportunity 
On expiry day, when volatility spikes, premiums can become dislocated. 
Example: 
Spot: 80,000. 
500 points OTM: 
- 80,500 CE: ₹25 
- 79,500 PE: ₹10 
Value difference: ₹15 
Both are equidistant from spot. Theoretically, they should have similar premiums (accounting for 
skew). 
The ₹79,500 PE is undervalued by ₹15. 
 Trading The Undervalue: 
Entry: Buy 79,500 PE at ₹10  
Stop loss: ₹7 (30% SL)  


=== PAGE {} ===
Target: ₹20 (100% return) 
Why this works: 
If spot moves toward 79,500, that PE will surge.  
Even if spot stays at 80,000, as volatility increases or the CE premium falls, the PE should revalue 
toward parity. 
Berlin notes: "This process is called option value adjustment. This will be discussed in detail in 
The Value Adjustment Theory chapter." 
Teaser for what's coming: You'll learn to systematically exploit these dislocations for 50-100% 
returns in minutes. 
 
 RULE 37: When Premium Value Trades Higher Than 
Straddle Value, Wide Range Coming 
 The Volatility Signal 
Straddle value = ATM Call premium + ATM Put premium 
When individual option premiums (especially OTM) start trading at values higher than what 
straddle math suggests, it signals: 
Market expects wide range movement 
Institutions are buying protection. Smart money anticipates volatility. 
 What To Do? 
If you're in directional trades: Reduce size or exit. Chop is coming. 
If you're an expiry trader: Get ready. Volatility = opportunity for Value Adjustment and 
Adjustment Theory strategies. If you're conservative: Stay out until direction clarifies. High 
straddle value is a warning sign of impending chaos. 
RULE 38: Major Reversal Timings—10:00 AM, 12:40 PM, 
2:10 PM, 2:50 PM 
The Institutional Rebalancing Windows 


=== PAGE {} ===
Berlin has observed (and data supports) that intraday reversals frequently occur at: 
10:00 AM: Post-opening consolidation/reversal 
12:40 PM: Pre-lunch institutional rebalancing 
2:10 PM: Post-lunch renewed activity 
2:50 PM: Pre-close positioning 
How To Use This? 
Approaching these times: 
Tighten stops if you're in profit. 
Be cautious entering new positions 5 minutes before. 
Watch for reversal patterns at these times. 
If you're wrong on direction before these times, these windows often give you a chance to exit at 
better prices. 
If you're right, these times can accelerate your move. 
Don't fight the clock. Respect institutional rhythms. 
RULE 39: When Trading Momentum—Cut Losses Fast & 
Let Winners Run 
The Golden Rule Of Momentum Trading 
Momentum trades are characterized by: 
Fast moves. High volatility. Short windows 
In momentum: 
If you're right: Price moves quickly in your favor. Premium explodes. Hold and trail stops. 
If you're wrong: Price moves quickly against you. Premium collapses. Exit immediately. 
Why This Works? 
Example 1: Winner 


=== PAGE {} ===
Enter call at ₹40. Within 5 minutes: ₹48. Within 10 minutes: ₹58. Within 20 minutes: ₹72. If you 
held: 80% gain. 
Example 2: Loser 
Enter call at ₹40. Within 5 minutes: ₹36. If you cut: 10% loss. If you held hoping: ₹28 by 15 
minutes → 30% loss. In momentum, early signals are accurate. Don't ignore them. 
RULE 40: If You Don't Take Risks For Your Opinion, You're 
Nothing 
The Conviction Question 
Berlin's challenge: 
"If you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing. Either you're going to win or you're 
going to learn—you've got nothing to lose." 
This doesn't mean reckless gambling. It means: If you've done the analysis, identified a setup, 
calculated risk—TAKE THE TRADE. 
How many times have you: 
Analyzed a setup perfectly 
Identified the entry 
Calculated risk-reward 
But didn't enter because of fear 
Then watched the trade work perfectly without you 
That's not caution. That's cowardice. 
Calculated Risk vs. Recklessness 
Reckless: "I think Nifty will go up, so I'll put 50% of my capital in random calls." 
Calculated: "I've identified support, confirmed trend, calculated 2% risk, defined stop loss and 
target. I'm entering." 
The difference: Process. Planning. Defined risk. 
Berlin's promise: With calculated risks, you either win (profit) or learn (lesson). Both are valuable. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Without risk, you guarantee one outcome: mediocrity. 
 
RULE 41: Option Buying Only During Clear Bullish/Bearish 
Momentum 
The Momentum Requirement 
Option buying (without hedges) is a directional bet with time decay working against you. You 
need momentum on your side to overcome theta. 
Berlin's rule: 
"If you're solely in option buying, only take risk when the market is clearly bullish or bearish. Do 
not trade when there is no momentum, or you might end up losing." 
The Chop Killer 
Scenario: 
Nifty is chopping between 24,950-25,050 for two hours. 
You buy calls at ₹40, expecting a breakout. 
Nifty continues chopping. 
Your ₹40 premium decays to ₹28 over the next hour due to theta, despite spot barely moving. 
Loss: 30% without spot even going against you. 
When NOT To Buy Options? 
Sideways price action. Low volume. Tight ranges. Midday lulls. 
Just before major news (unless you're experienced with event volatility) 
When TO Buy Options? 
Clear trend (higher highs + higher lows, or lower lows + lower highs). Increasing volume. 
Momentum candles (large body, small wicks). Breakouts of consolidation. 
Post-news clarity (after event, when direction is confirmed) 
In doubt? Stay out. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Preserving capital during no-momentum periods means you have capital for explosive momentum 
periods. 
The Foundation Is Complete—Now You're Ready 
If you've read this far and internalized even half of these rules, you're already operating at a level 
above 80% of retail traders. 
These aren't just "tips." They're the operating system that successful trading runs on. 
Before Numerical Theory, Value Adjustment Theory, Adjustment Theory, and Big Money 
Theory can work for you, this foundation must be solid. 
Because here's the truth: 
Those advanced strategies are powerful amplifiers. 
If your foundation is solid → they amplify your profits 
If your foundation is weak → they amplify your losses 
The 9% Club Invitation: 
You now have the rules. The question is: Will you follow them? 
91% of traders won't. 
They'll read this, nod along, maybe even take notes. Then they'll: 
Chase a momentum move without defined risk. 
Hold a losing trade hoping it reverses. 
Overtrade during a losing streak. 
Fight the trend because their "analysis" says otherwise. 
And they'll lose. 
But you? You have a choice. 
You can join the 9%—the minority who consistently profit—by doing what's uncomfortable: 
Following rules when emotions scream otherwise 
-Cutting losses when ego wants to hold 


=== PAGE {} ===
-Letting winners run when fear wants to book 
-Staying out when FOMO wants you in 
-Trading with discipline when others trade with hope 
The 9% aren't smarter. They're more disciplined. 
The 9% aren't luckier. They're more systematic. 
The 9% didn't start with more capital. They preserved and compounded what they had. 
Your Next Steps 
Print this chapter or save it digitally where you'll see it daily 
Before every trading session, review 3-5 rules 
After every trading day, journal which rules you followed and which you broke 
At the end of each week, grade yourself on rule adherence (not P&L) 
After 90 days of following these rules, evaluate your transformation 
I guarantee: Your trading will be unrecognizable from where you started. 
Not because the market changed. 
Because you changed. 
The Promise Of What's Coming 
Now that your foundation is solid, you're ready for the advanced theories: 
Numerical Theory will show you how to identify 3%+ moves and scalp 30-50% returns 
systematically. 
Value Adjustment Theory will teach you to spot undervalued options on expiry day and capture 
40-80% gains in minutes. 
Adjustment Theory will reveal how to trade the final 15 minutes of expiry day when premiums 
thrash violently. 
Big Money Theory will help you identify where institutions accumulated and how to follow their 
footprints for explosive returns. 


=== PAGE {} ===
But none of those will work without this foundation. 
The Berlin Commitment 
"I've given you these rules because I've paid for them—with losses, with pain, with years of trial 
and error." 
Your job is simple: 
Take these rules seriously. Practice them religiously. Let them become reflexes. 
Because when you face that ₹10 lakh opportunity—and you will—you'll need these rules to have 
the capital, psychology, and discipline to capture it. 
The 9% club isn't exclusive. It's selective. 
It selects those who are willing to be disciplined in a world of impulsive traders. 
Are you one of them? 
The next chapters will prove it. 
"The minority wins 8 out of 10 times. The majority wins 2 out of 10. You've just learned how to 
think, act, and trade like the minority. Now prove you belong here." — Berlin

 The Numerical Theory 
A Systematic Approach to Intraday Options Trading 
In the dynamic world of options trading, where complexity often overshadows simplicity, the 
Numerical Theory emerges as a refreshingly straightforward strategy designed for the Indian 
derivatives market. This approach strips away unnecessary complications and focuses on a 
fundamental market principle: momentum continuation combined with precise technical entry 
points. Unlike elaborate multi-leg strategies or complex mathematical models, Numerical Theory 
relies on clear numerical thresholds and disciplined execution, making it accessible to both novice 
and experienced traders. 
The beauty of this strategy lies in its binary decision-making framework. You're not analyzing 
multiple indicators, juggling various timeframes, or struggling with conflicting signals. Instead, 
you're working with concrete numbers: a 3% move, ATM strikes, high break entries, and 
predetermined risk-reward ratios. This article explores the mechanics, psychology, and practical 
application of Numerical Theory in the context of NSE (National Stock Exchange) equity options. 
 Understanding the Core Framework 
 The 3% Threshold: Why This Number Matters? 
The first pillar of Numerical Theory is the 3% movement threshold. This isn't an arbitrary number 
but represents a statistically significant move in the Indian equity market context. When a stock 
moves 3% or more in either direction during a trading session, it signals strong momentum backed 
by substantial buying or selling pressure. 
Consider the average daily volatility of Nifty 50 stocks, which typically ranges between 1% to 2% 
under normal market conditions. A 3% move represents an outlier, a departure from the mean that 
suggests institutional participation, news-driven momentum, or significant order flow imbalance. 
This threshold effectively filters out noise and identifies stocks where conviction is high and 
follow-through is probable. 
In the Indian market, where retail participation has surged in recent years, a 3% move also indicates 
that the stock has captured broad market attention. It appears on gainers/losers lists, triggers price 
alerts, and attracts momentum traders. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where visibility breeds 
further interest, potentially extending the move. 
 Strike Selection: The ATM Advantage 
The choice of At-The-Money (ATM) strikes is strategic and rooted in options pricing dynamics. 
ATM options offer the optimal balance between delta (price sensitivity), premium affordability, 
and liquidity. 


=== PAGE {} ===
When you select ATM calls on a gainer or ATM puts on a loser, you're positioning yourself with 
approximately 0.50 delta. This means for every one-point move in the underlying stock, your 
option premium moves by roughly 0.50 points. This provides meaningful exposure without the 
excessive premium cost of In-The-Money (ITM) options or the low probability of Out-of-The-
Money (OTM) options. 
Furthermore, ATM strikes typically have the highest open interest and trading volume, ensuring 
tight bid-ask spreads and easy entry-exit execution. In the Indian market, where liquidity can thin 
out quickly in far OTM strikes, this consideration is critical for risk management. 
 High Break Entry: The Technical Trigger 
Perhaps the most nuanced aspect of Numerical Theory is the "High Break" entry point. This refers 
to entering the trade when the option premium breaks above its recent high, typically the high of 
the previous candle on your chosen timeframe (usually 5-minute or 15-minute charts for intraday 
trading). 
This entry mechanism serves multiple purposes. First, it confirms that the momentum in the 
underlying stock is translating into option premium appreciation. Second, it ensures you're not 
catching a falling knife or buying at local tops. Third, it aligns your entry with actual price action 
rather than predictions. 
For instance, if you've identified an ATM call option with a premium trading between ₹45 and 
₹52, and the recent high is ₹52, you would place your buy order at ₹52.05 or ₹52.10. Once the 
premium breaks and holds above ₹52, your order executes, confirming that buying pressure is 
strong enough to push through resistance. 
 Risk-Reward Structure: The Disciplined Approach 
The defined risk-reward parameters—10% stop loss and 30-50% profit target—create a favorable 
probability framework. With a minimum 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio, you can afford to be wrong on 
multiple trades and still remain profitable. If you achieve a 40% success rate with this risk-reward 
profile, you're profitable overall. 
The 10% stop loss is tight enough to preserve capital but wide enough to accommodate normal 
option premium fluctuations and volatility. It prevents catastrophic losses while acknowledging 
that not every trade will work immediately. The 30-50% target range provides flexibility to book 
profits based on time decay considerations, market conditions, and the strength of the underlying 
move. 
 Example 1: Capitalizing on a Tech Stock Rally 
 Scenario Setup: 


=== PAGE {} ===
Let's examine a real-world application. On a typical trading day, you scan the market at 10:30 AM 
and notice that Infosys Ltd is trading at ₹1,530, up 3.5% from the previous day's close of ₹1,478. 
The move is triggered by a positive brokerage upgrade and strong global IT sector sentiment. 
You decide to apply Numerical Theory: 
Step 1: Qualification Check 
- Current Price: ₹1,530 
- Movement: +3.5% (Qualifies, as it's above 3%) 
- Trend: Clear uptrend with green candles and increasing volum 
Step 2: Strike Selection 
- ATM strike: ₹1,530 Call (weekly expiry, 2 days to expiration) 
- Current premium: ₹24.50 (trading range: ₹22.80 to ₹26.30) 
- Recent high on 15-minute chart: ₹26.30 
Step 3: Entry Setup 
- You place a buy order at ₹26.40 (High Break entry) 
- The stock continues its upward momentum, and at 10:47 AM, your order executes as the premium 
touches ₹26.40 
- Entry premium: ₹26.40 
- Lot size: 600 shares (standard Infosys lot) 
- Investment: ₹26.40 × 600 = ₹15,840 
Step 4: Risk Management 
- Stop loss: 10% below entry = ₹26.40 - ₹2.64 = ₹23.76 
- Maximum risk: ₹2.64 × 600 = ₹1,584 
- Target 1 (30%): ₹26.40 × 1.30 = ₹34.32 
- Target 2 (50%): ₹26.40 × 1.50 = ₹39.60 
 


=== PAGE {} ===
 Trade Progression: 
By 12:15 PM, Infosys climbs to ₹1,548 (+4.7% for the day), and your ₹1,530 Call premium reaches 
₹35.20. You decide to book 50% of your position at ₹35.20, securing a 33.3% gain on half your 
contracts. 
- Profit on 300 contracts: (₹35.20 - ₹26.40) × 300 = ₹2,640 
You trail your stop loss on the remaining 300 contracts to your entry point (₹26.40), making it a 
risk-free trade. By 2:30 PM, the stock consolidates around ₹1,545, and your premium touches 
₹38.50. You exit the remaining position. 
- Profit on remaining 300 contracts: (₹38.50 - ₹26.40) × 300 = ₹3,630 
- Total profit: ₹2,640 + ₹3,630 = ₹6,270 
- Return on investment: ₹6,270 / ₹15,840 = 39.6% 
 Key Takeaways: 
This trade exemplifies Numerical Theory's strength in trending markets. The 3% threshold 
identified genuine momentum, the ATM strike provided optimal leverage, the high break entry 
confirmed continuation, and disciplined profit-booking secured substantial gains. The partial exit 
strategy also demonstrated how you can lock in profits while maintaining exposure to extended 
moves. 
 Example 2: Profiting from a Banking Stock Decline 
 Scenario Setup: 
Let's examine the opposite scenario—a falling stock. At 11:00 AM, you observe that HDFC Bank 
is trading at ₹1,612, down 3.2% from the previous close of ₹1,665. The decline is attributed to 
disappointing quarterly results announced the previous evening and broader banking sector 
weakness. 
Step 1: Qualification Check 
- Current Price: ₹1,612 
- Movement: -3.2% (Qualifies, as it's below -3%) 
- Trend: Clear downtrend with consecutive red candles and selling pressure 
Step 2: Strike Selection 
- ATM strike: ₹1,610 Put (weekly expiry, 3 days to expiration) 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Current premium: ₹18.75 (trading range: ₹16.40 to ₹19.80) 
- Recent high on 15-minute chart: ₹19.80 
Step 3: Entry Setup 
- You place a buy order at ₹19.90 (High Break entry) 
- At 11:18 AM, as selling intensifies and the stock breaks ₹1,605, your order executes 
- Entry premium: ₹19.90 
- Lot size: 550 shares (standard HDFC Bank lot) 
- Investment: ₹19.90 × 550 = ₹10,945 
Step 4: Risk Management 
- Stop loss: 10% below entry = ₹19.90 - ₹1.99 = ₹17.91 
- Maximum risk: ₹1.99 × 550 = ₹1,094.50 
- Target 1 (30%): ₹19.90 × 1.30 = ₹25.87 
- Target 2 (50%): ₹19.90 × 1.50 = ₹29.85 
 Trade Progression 
By 1:45 PM, HDFC Bank falls to ₹1,585 (-4.8% for the day), and your ₹1,610 Put premium surges 
to ₹28.40. This represents a 42.7% gain, falling between your 30% and 50% targets. Given that 
significant support exists around ₹1,580 and considering theta decay with three days to expiry, you 
decide to exit your entire position. 
- Profit: (₹28.40 - ₹19.90) × 550 = ₹4,675 
- Return on investment: ₹4,675 / ₹10,945 = 42.7% 
 What If the Trade Failed? 
Not every application of Numerical Theory succeeds. Let's consider an alternate scenario where, 
at 11:45 AM, HDFC Bank finds support and rebounds to ₹1,620. Your ₹1,610 Put premium drops 
to ₹17.50, breaching your stop loss of ₹17.91. 
- Loss: (₹19.90 - ₹17.50) × 550 = ₹1,320 
- Loss percentage: ₹1,320 / ₹10,945 = 12.1% 


=== PAGE {} ===
Even though your loss slightly exceeded the planned 10% (due to slippage in execution), the 
damage is contained. With a risk-reward ratio of 3:1 or better, one winning trade compensates for 
three such losses, demonstrating the strategy's mathematical edge. 
 Key Takeaways: 
This example highlights Numerical Theory's versatility in bearish scenarios. The same principles 
apply regardless of direction: identify momentum, select appropriate strikes, wait for confirmation, 
and manage risk ruthlessly. The put option provided leveraged exposure to downside movement 
without the margin requirements and overnight risk of short selling. 
 Example 3: The False Breakout Learning 
 Scenario Setup: 
Not every 3% move sustains itself, and understanding failed trades is crucial for mastery. Consider 
Tata Motors opening at ₹1,048, up 3.4% on the back of strong monthly sales numbers released 
pre-market. 
Step 1-2: Initial Setup 
- Movement: +3.4% (Qualifies) 
- ATM strike: ₹1,050 Call 
- Current premium: ₹15.20 (recent high: ₹16.80) 
Step 3: Entry Attempt 
- You place a buy order at ₹16.90 (High Break entry) 
- At 10:05 AM, the premium spikes to ₹17.20 on initial enthusiasm, executing your order 
- Entry premium: ₹17.20 
- Lot size: 1,800 shares (standard Tata Motors lot) 
- Investment: ₹17.20 × 1,800 = ₹30,960 
Step 4: Risk Management 
- Stop loss: ₹17.20 - ₹1.72 = ₹15.48 
- Maximum risk: ₹1.72 × 1,800 = ₹3,096 
 What Went Wrong? 


=== PAGE {} ===
By 10:30 AM, it becomes apparent that the opening gap-up was primarily due to short covering 
rather than fresh buying. The stock begins to fade, trading at ₹1,042 (only +2.4%). Your option 
premium declines to ₹14.80, triggering your stop loss. 
- Loss: (₹17.20 - ₹14.80) × 1,800 = ₹4,320 
- Loss percentage: ₹4,320 / ₹30,960 = 13.9% 
 Analysis and Lessons: 
This trade violated a subtle but important aspect of Numerical Theory: timing. The 3% move 
occurred entirely in the pre-market and opening seconds. By the time you entered (post high 
break), the initial momentum had exhausted. This example teaches several crucial lessons: 
Lesson 1: Quality of Movement Matters 
A gradual 3% move built over 30-45 minutes with increasing volume is more sustainable than a 
gap opening. The ideal scenario is when a stock crosses the 3% threshold during market hours, 
indicating active participation. 
Lesson 2: Context is Critical 
In this case, the sales numbers were positive but largely in line with expectations. The move was 
more technical (short covering) than fundamental. Combining Numerical Theory with basic 
fundamental awareness improves selectivity. 
Lesson 3: Strict Stop Loss Discipline Saved Capital 
Despite the loss exceeding 10% (due to slippage), the predefined exit prevented a larger drawdown. 
Without this discipline, many traders hold losing positions hoping for recovery, turning a 
manageable loss into a catastrophic one. 
Lesson 4: Failed Trades Are Part of the Process 
Even with the loss, if your next two trades achieve 35% gains each, you're still profitable overall. 
The strategy's mathematical edge comes from consistently applying the rules, not from winning 
every trade. 
 Risk Management and Position Sizing, Capital Allocation, Proper position sizing is fundamental 
to long-term success with Numerical Theory. A recommended approach for the Indian market: 
Conservative traders: Risk 1-2% of trading capital per trade. If your capital is ₹5,00,000, your 
maximum risk per trade is ₹5,000-₹10,000. With a 10% stop loss, your position size would be 
₹50,000-₹1,00,000. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Aggressive traders: Risk up to 3-5% per trade. With the same ₹5,00,000 capital, you might risk 
₹15,000-₹25,000, translating to positions of ₹1,50,000-₹2,50,000. 
Never risk more than 5% on a single trade, regardless of confidence level. Remember, options can 
move violently, and even perfect setups can fail. 
 Maximum Daily Trades: 
Numerical Theory works best with selective application. Limit yourself to 2-3 trades per day. This 
discipline prevents overtrading, reduces transaction costs, and ensures you're only taking the 
highest-probability setups. On many days, no stock will meet the 3% threshold with favorable 
conditions, and that's perfectly fine. Capital preservation through inaction is often more profitable 
than forcing marginal trades. 
 Weekly Expiry Considerations: 
In the Indian market, weekly options on major indices and select stocks have created new 
opportunities but also new risks. For Numerical Theory: 
Optimal timeframe: Options with 2-4 days to expiry offer the best balance. They have enough time 
value to capture extended moves but sufficient theta decay to provide rapid profits if the trade 
works. 
Avoid: Options expiring the same day (unless you're experienced with zero-DTE trading) or 
options with more than one week to expiry (the 30-50% targets become harder to achieve quickly). 
 Advanced Tips for Indian Market Application: 
 Market Timing: Numerical Theory works best during specific market hours: 
9:30 AM - 10:30 AM: The opening hour often establishes the day's tone. If a stock crosses 3% 
during this period with volume, it's a strong signal. However, be cautious of opening volatility and 
wider spreads. 
11:00 AM - 1:30 PM: The mid-day session often sees genuine continuation moves after the 
opening noise settles. This is often the sweet spot for Numerical Theory entries. 
2:30 PM - 3:30 PM: The final hour can offer opportunities, but be mindful of closing squaring-off 
pressures that can create whipsaws. 
Avoid: The last 15 minutes (3:15 PM - 3:30 PM) unless you're closing positions, as volatility and 
randomness increase. 
 Sector Rotation Awareness: 


=== PAGE {} ===
The Indian market often moves in sectoral rotations. If banking stocks are showing 3%+ moves 
across multiple names, it indicates sectoral momentum. Applying Numerical Theory to multiple 
stocks in a strong sector increases success probability, but also concentrates risk. Balance 
opportunity with diversification. 
 News and Event Catalysts: 
Numerical Theory naturally aligns with news-driven moves. Corporate results, policy 
announcements, global cues, or sector-specific developments often trigger the 3%+ moves that 
qualify for this strategy. However, distinguish between sustainable news (earnings beats, contracts 
wins, policy changes) and transient noise (rumors, unverified reports). 
 Overcoming FOMO: 
The biggest challenge with Numerical Theory isn't technical—it's psychological. When you see a 
stock ripping 5-6% and you haven't entered, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) tempts you to chase. 
Resist this urge ruthlessly. Wait for the high break entry, even if it means missing some moves 
entirely. Chasing trades without proper setups is the fastest path to losses. 
 Accepting Losses: 
With a 10% stop loss, you will have losing trades. Accept this reality upfront. Each loss is simply 
the cost of business, the premium you pay for the option to participate in winning trades. Don't 
revenge trade, don't double down, and don't abandon the strategy after a few losses. Trust the 
mathematics. 
 Booking Profits Without Regret: 
When you exit at a 35% gain and the option subsequently runs to 80%, you will feel regret. This 
is natural but irrational. You executed your plan, secured profits, and preserved capital for the next 
opportunity. The option that made 80% is visible; the dozens that collapsed after showing initial 
promise are forgotten. Survivors hip bias distorts perception. Stick to your targets. 
 Conclusion: 
Numerical Theory represents a paradigm shift in how retail traders can approach the Indian 
derivatives market. In an environment cluttered with complex strategies, indicator-laden charts, 
and conflicting advice, this approach offers clarity. It transforms subjective decision-making into 
objective rules: 3% movement, ATM strikes, high break entries, and disciplined risk-reward 
management. 
The strategy's power lies not in sophistication but in simplicity and consistency. It doesn't require 
advanced technical analysis skills, expensive software, or insider information. What it demands is 
discipline—the discipline to wait for proper setups, execute according to plan, accept losses 
without emotion, and book profits without greed. 


=== PAGE {} ===
For traders in the Indian market, where volatility provides frequent opportunities but also 
substantial risks, Numerical Theory offers a structured framework to harness momentum while 
managing downside. Whether you're trading Nifty constituents, Bank Nifty stocks, or broader 
market opportunities, the principles remain consistent. 
Remember, no strategy wins 100% of the time. Numerical Theory's edge comes from favorable 
risk-reward ratios and consistent application. Master the basics, backtest on paper, start with small 
positions, and scale gradually as confidence builds. The simplest strategies, executed with 
unwavering discipline, often outperform the most sophisticated approaches implemented 
inconsistently. 
In the words of legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones, "Don't focus on making money; focus on 
protecting what you have." Numerical Theory embodies this wisdom—capturing meaningful gains 
while ruthlessly protecting capital. That combination, sustained over time, is the foundation of 
trading success.

The Premium You're Leaving on the Table: Value 
Adjustment Theory 
 The Scenarios That Haunt Every Options Trader 
Scenario 1: The Missed Opportunity 
It's expiry day. 11:30 AM. You're watching Nifty drop like a stone—down 80 points in 30 minutes. 
Your gut screams "BUY PUTS!" but which strike? You hesitate. By the time you decide, the 
premiums have already exploded. You either chase at inflated prices or watch from the sidelines 
as others bank 3x, 4x returns in an hour. 
Sound familiar? 
Scenario 2: The Unequal Twins 
You notice something odd. Nifty is at 24,950. The 25,200 CE (250 points OTM) is trading at ₹28. 
The 24,700 PE (also 250 points OTM) is trading at ₹15. 
Wait—they're equidistant from spot. Why is one trading at nearly double the premium of the other? 
Is it a bug? Market manipulation? Or are you missing something fundamental? 
Scenario 3: The Expiry Day Gamble 
It's Thursday, 2:00 PM—one hour to Nifty expiry. Your screen shows dozens of strikes flashing 
red and green. Premiums jumping 50%, 100%, 200% within minutes. Your trading group is 
buzzing with screenshots of ₹5,000 turning into ₹50,000. 
But you're paralyzed. How do they know *which* strike to buy? How do they time it? It feels like 
a casino, not a strategy. 
If you've experienced any of these situations, you've stumbled upon the edges of a concept that 
separates systematic expiry traders from gamblers: 
Value Adjustment Theory. 
 What Is Value Adjustment Theory? 
Let me give you Berlin's definition: 
 "The adjustment process of difference in value of premium among equidistant strikes from Spot 
in a given time is called Value Adjustment." 


=== PAGE {} ===
In simpler terms: When two strikes are the same distance from the current Nifty spot price, they 
should theoretically have similar premiums (accounting for slight skew). When they don't—when 
one is significantly undervalued compared to the other—that's a Value Adjustment opportunity. 
This isn't arbitrage in the classic sense. It's not risk-free. But it's a systematic edge based on 
premium inefficiency that occurs repeatedly during the final days before expiry, especially on 
expiry day itself. 
 Why Value Adjustment Theory Is Hard? Here's the uncomfortable truth: Understanding Value 
Adjustment is brutally difficult. 
Why? 
Because TIME plays a very major role, and understanding the behavior of dynamic premium 
demand utmost attention and tremendous practice. 
Let me break down why this is harder than your typical options strategy: 
 1. Premiums Move Non-Linearly 
You can't just look at spot movement and predict premium movement linearly. A 50-point drop in 
Nifty doesn't translate to a proportional premium increase in puts. Volatility, time decay, demand-
supply at specific strikes, and market sentiment all interplay simultaneously. 
 2. Time Decay Accelerates Exponentially 
In the final 48 hours before expiry, theta (time decay) doesn't just increase—it explodes. A 
premium worth ₹20 at 11 AM might be ₹8 by 2 PM even if spot hasn't moved, simply because 
time is evaporating. 
 3. Dynamic Premium Behavior 
Premiums don't follow textbooks on expiry day. Fear drives puts higher than mathematical models 
suggest. Gamma squeezes can spike calls irrationally. Max pain gravitational pull can keep certain 
strikes suppressed. You're reading market psychology as much as mathematics. 
 4. Split-Second Windows 
Value Adjustment opportunities can appear and disappear within 5-10 minutes. Miss the entry, 
and you're either chasing or sitting out. There's no "I'll analyze this after lunch" luxury. 
This is why Berlin emphasizes: PRACTICE. And PRACTICE. And PRACTICE. 
You cannot learn this from one article. You need screen time. You need to watch hundreds of 
expiries. You need to see patterns repeat until recognition becomes instinctive. 


=== PAGE {} ===
 When to Trade Value Adjustment? 
Berlin's framework is crystal clear: 
Start from 2 days before expiry. Best results on the day of expiry. 
Using notation: 
- ex-d2: Two days before expiry (Tuesday if Thursday expiry) 
- ex-d1: One day before expiry (Wednesday if Thursday expiry)  
- ex-d0: Expiry day (Thursday for Nifty) 
Most favorable time window: Expiry day, 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM 
Why these specific days? 
Because as expiry approaches: 
- Time value collapses rapidly, making intrinsic value movements more pronounced 
- Liquidity concentrates in fewer strikes, creating clearer patterns 
- Institutional unwinding and retail speculation create premium dislocations 
- The market's magnetic pull toward max pain becomes observable 
On ex-d2, opportunities exist but are subtle. On ex-d1, they become more pronounced. On ex-d0, 
they're screaming at you—if you know how to listen. 
 The Mindset Shift: Charts Don't Matter Here 
This is where Value Adjustment Theory diverges dramatically from conventional technical 
trading. There is not much importance of chart in Value Adjustment. Read that again. Let it sink 
in. You're not looking for support-resistance. You're not waiting for moving average crossovers. 
You're not drawing trendlines. What matters are SPOT and PREMIUM. 
That's it. Two numbers: 
1. Where is Nifty spot right now? 
2. What are the premiums of equidistant strikes? 
Your entire analysis happens in the options chain, not the price chart. 


=== PAGE {} ===
 Understanding Value Adjustment: The Core Framework 
Let's walk through Berlin's methodology step by step. 
 Initial Setup 
Scenario: 
- Nifty Spot: 25,000 
- 25,000 CE (ATM Call): ₹100 
- 25,000 PE (ATM Put): ₹90 
First, you establish a reference point: Look for 300 points OTM premiums on both sides. 
- 25,300 CE (300 points OTM call): ₹20 
- 24,700 PE (300 points OTM put): ₹15 
Difference in value: ₹5 
So the 24,700 PE is theoretically undervalued by ₹5 compared to its equidistant call counterpart. 
 The Critical Question: Is This Tradeable? 
Berlin's answer: NO. Not yet. 
Why? Risk-Reward ratio is very less. 
If you buy the 24,700 PE at ₹15 expecting it to reach ₹20 (to match the call premium), you're 
risking ₹15 to make ₹5. That's a 1:0.33 risk-reward ratio. Terrible. 
Even if you're right about the undervaluation, the market might never correct it before expiry. 
Theta will eat your premium. You'll lose despite being conceptually correct. 
This is the first lesson: Value Adjustment opportunities require meaningful dislocation, not just 
any difference. 
Now the scenario evolves: 
Spot moves down to 24,950 from 25,000 (50-point drop) 
Premium update: 
- 25,300 CE: ₹18 (down from ₹20, as expected—spot moved away from it) 


=== PAGE {} ===
- 24,700 PE: ₹15 (UNCHANGED—this is the anomaly) 
This is called an Opportunity. 
Why? Let's clear the picture. 
 The Value Adjustment Calculation: 
Spot dropped 50 points to 24,950. 
Now we recalculate equidistance: 
- Distance from 24,950 to 24,700 PE: 250 points 
- We need to find the call strike that's 250 points away: 25,200 CE 
Premium reality check: 
- 24,700 PE (250 points OTM): ₹15 
- 25,200 CE (250 points OTM): ₹28 to ₹30 
The 24,700 PE should be trading at ₹28-30 if markets were efficient. 
But it's at ₹15. 
That's a ₹13-15 undervaluation (using the midpoint of ₹28.50). 
Now your risk-reward transforms: 
- Entry: ₹15 
- Conservative target: ₹25 (still below fair value) 
- Potential target: ₹30 (fair value) 
- Risk if wrong: ₹15 
- Reward if right: ₹10-15 
Risk-Reward ratio: 1:0.67 to 1:1 
Much better. Now it's tradeable. 
 The Worst-Case Validation 


=== PAGE {} ===
Berlin adds another layer of confirmation: 
Even in the worst possible scenario, what should 24,700 PE be worth? 
Look at 25,300 CE. Spot is now at 24,950, making 25,300 CE 350 points OTM. Yet it's still trading 
at ₹18. 
By that logic, 24,700 PE, which is only 250 points OTM (closer to spot), should be worth *at least* 
₹18. 
So your worst-case floor is ₹18, and you're entering at ₹15. 
Minimum expected return: 20% (₹15 → ₹18)  
Realistic return: 67-100% (₹15 → ₹25-30) 
Here momentum plays a major role. 
If Nifty spot is falling with momentum—strong selling, increasing volumes, VIX spiking—the 
probability of that 24,700 PE reaching or exceeding fair value increases dramatically. If the move 
is weak—just a minor dip with no follow-through—the premium might correct only partially. 
This is where you combine Value Adjustment (mathematical framework) with market reading 
(momentum assessment). 
 Extended Scenario: Compounding the Edge 
Let's extend Berlin's example to see how this unfolds: 
 Second Wave. 
Spot drops another 50 points: 24,950 → 24,900 
New calculation: 
- Distance from 24,900 to 24,700 PE: 200 points 
- Equidistant call strike: 25,100 CE 
Premium reality: 
- 24,700 PE: ₹25 (finally moving up from ₹15) 
- 25,100 CE: ₹35 
Reference premiums for context: 


=== PAGE {} ===
- 25,200 CE: ₹24 
- 25,300 CE: ₹14 
 The Fair Value Question 
What should 24,700 PE be trading at? 
Since 25,100 CE (200 points OTM) is at ₹35, the 24,700 PE (also 200 points OTM) should be at 
₹35. 
But it's only at ₹25. Still undervalued by ₹10. 
 The Trade: 
Entry: ₹25  
Target: ₹35 (fair value)  
Potential: 40% return (₹25 → ₹35) 
But Berlin notes something crucial: 
 "As momentum and volatility have major role in it, the trade could be extended up to 2X, 3X, 4X 
and even more in certain scenarios." 
If the downward momentum accelerates—if panic sets in, if a key support breaks, if VIX spikes 
further—that ₹25 premium can explode to ₹50, ₹75, or even ₹100. 
This isn't greed. It's understanding that on expiry day, with high volatility and momentum, 
premiums can overshoot fair value significantly before correcting. 
 The Three Pillars of Value Adjustment Mastery 
After studying Berlin's framework, three critical pillars emerge: 
 1. Mathematical Framework (The What) 
You must constantly calculate: 
- Current spot position 
- Equidistant strikes on both sides 
- Premium comparison 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Degree of undervaluation/overvaluation 
This requires maintaining a mental (or actual) spreadsheet of strikes and premiums, updating every 
few minutes during the trading window. 
 2. Momentum Reading (The When) 
Math tells you 'what' is undervalued. Momentum tells you 'when' to enter. If premiums are 
dislocated but spot is stagnant, you wait. If premiums are dislocated *and* spot is moving with 
conviction in the favorable direction, you enter. 
Momentum indicators: 
- Pace of spot movement (50 points in 10 minutes vs. 50 points in an hour) 
- Volume on the underlying 
- VIX behavior (spiking vs. stable) 
- Premium velocity (how fast the undervalued option is starting to move) 
 3. Execution Discipline (The How) 
Value Adjustment opportunities are time-sensitive. You need: 
Pre-planned watchlists: Know which strikes you're monitoring before the day starts. 
Rapid calculation: You can't spend 10 minutes doing math. By then, the opportunity is gone. 
Decisive execution: When math + momentum align, you act. No second-guessing. 
Exit discipline: Know your targets. Book profits at fair value unless momentum suggests 
extension. Don't get greedy and watch fair value return to undervalued. 
 Why This Demands Practice (And More Practice)? 
Berlin repeats this like a mantra: 
 Value Adjustment theory demands PRACTICE. And PRACTICE. And PRACTICE. Then only 
the concept could be understood. 
Why is he so insistent? 
Because Value Adjustment isn't a formula you learn once and apply mechanically. It's a skill you 
develop through observation. 


=== PAGE {} ===
You need to watch: 
- How premiums behave on 50 different expiry days 
- How Value Adjustment opportunities appear and disappear 
- How momentum affects premium convergence speed 
- How volatility spikes create overshoot opportunities 
- How max pain affects late-day premium compression 
- How time decay accelerates in the final hour 
You can't learn this from theory. You must witness it. 
Recommendation for practice: 
Month 1-2: Paper trade only. Watch every expiry. Record spot positions, premiums, and your 
theoretical entries/exits. Review afterward. 
Month 3-4: Trade with minimum capital (1-2 lots). Focus on execution and psychology, not profits. 
Month 5+: Scale gradually as pattern recognition becomes instinctive. 
 Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them) 
 Mistake 1: Ignoring Time Decay 
You identify an undervalued strike at 11 AM on expiry day. It's ₹8 undervalued. You enter. By 
2:30 PM, spot hasn't moved much, and theta has crushed your premium despite it being "fairly 
valued." 
Solution: Value Adjustment works best when combined with momentum. Static undervaluation 
without spot movement is a theta trap. 
 Mistake 2: Chasing After the Move 
You see a perfect setup—but you hesitate. By the time you decide, the premium has already moved 
from ₹15 to ₹28. You enter at ₹28, expecting it to reach ₹35. It does, briefly, but you don't exit. It 
falls back to ₹25. You exit at a loss despite being "right." 
Solution: Pre-define entry zones. If you miss the initial entry, wait for the next opportunity. Don't 
chase. 
 Mistake 3: Over-Leveraging 


=== PAGE {} ===
You spot a high-probability Value Adjustment setup. You're confident. You deploy 50% of your 
capital on one trade. The setup fails due to unexpected news or manipulation. You're down 
significantly. 
Solution: Even high-probability setups fail. Risk management remains paramount. 2-5% risk per 
trade maximum. 
 Mistake 4: Ignoring Max Pain 
On expiry day, especially after 2 PM, max pain (the strike with maximum open interest) exerts 
gravitational pull. If your undervalued strike is far from max pain, the premium might never reach 
fair value as the market compresses toward max pain. 
Solution: Check max pain levels. Favor trades where momentum is toward max pain or where your 
strike is near max pain. 
 The Berlin Advantage: Why This Works 
Value Adjustment Theory works because it exploits a fundamental market inefficiency: premium 
dislocation during high-velocity time decay. 
On expiry day: 
- Institutional traders are unwinding positions 
- Retail traders are speculating based on momentum 
- Market makers are managing gamma risk 
- Algorithms are recalculating Greeks continuously 
In this chaos, premiums don't always adjust instantaneously to spot movements. Temporary 
inefficiencies emerge. Value Adjustment systematically captures these inefficiencies. 
It's not arbitrage (no guaranteed profit), but it's a statistical edge that, applied consistently with 
proper risk management, compounds over time. 
 Your Path Forward: 
Value Adjustment Theory isn't a "get rich quick" scheme. It's a specialized skill that requires: 
Deep understanding of options Greeks  
Real-time calculation ability  
Momentum reading capability  


=== PAGE {} ===
Execution speed  
Emotional discipline  
Hundreds of hours of screen time  
But here's the promise: 
Master this, and you'll have an edge on the most volatile, opportunity-rich days of the month—
expiry days—when most traders are either paralyzed by complexity or gambling randomly. 
You'll see opportunities others miss. 
You'll enter with mathematical backing while others chase emotions. 
You'll exit with predetermined targets while others hold hoping for miracles. 
That's the difference between trading like Berlin and trading like the crowd. 
 Final Words 
The premiums you're leaving on the table aren't accidents. They're opportunities obscured by 
complexity. Value Adjustment Theory removes that obscurity. 
But remember Berlin's warning: This demands practice. 
Start today. Open your options chain on the next ex-d2 day. Watch. Calculate. Observe. Don't trade 
yet—just watch. 
Do this for 20 expiries. 
Then, and only then, will you truly understand what Berlin means when he says: 
"The difference in value is the difference between average traders and those who consistently profit 
from expiry day chaos." 
The choice, as always, is yours. 
P.S. - If you found this complex, good. It means you're taking it seriously. Simple strategies are 
crowded. Complex strategies that become instinctive through practice? That's where edges live.

The Adjustment Theory 
Scalping the Final Chaos of Expiry Day 
 The 3:00 PM Battlefield 
Picture this: It's 3:00 PM on a Thursday. Nifty expiry day. 
Your screen shows premiums flashing like a broken traffic light—₹12... ₹8... ₹15... ₹6. Up, down, 
up, down. Every few seconds, values change. Your heart races. Others are making money in these 
final minutes. You can 'feel' it. 
But you're frozen. Paralyzed by the chaos. 
Which strike? Calls or Puts? Enter now or wait? What if it gaps against me? 
By 3:15 PM, the moment has passed. Premiums have collapsed to ₹1-2. The opportunity—
whatever it was—has evaporated like morning mist. 
You sit there, frustrated, watching others post screenshots of ₹5,000 turning into ₹15,000 in twelve 
minutes. 
What did they see that you didn't? 
If this scenario feels familiar, you've encountered the exact problem that Adjustment Theory was 
designed to solve. 
This isn't Value Adjustment Theory (which we discussed earlier for spotting undervalued 
premiums across strikes). This is something different—something laser-focused on the final 15-
30 minutes of expiry day, where time decay accelerates into a brutal sprint and premiums don't die 
quietly—they thrash, spike, collapse, and rebound one last time before expiring worthless. 
Adjustment Theory is your framework for navigating that final battlefield. 
 What Is Adjustment Theory? 
Let me give you Berlin's definition: 
Adjustment Theory is an intraday scalping strategy executed in the last 15-30 minutes of expiry 
day, targeting the ATM straddle and capitalizing on temporary premium imbalances caused by 
market micro-oscillations during the final decay phase. 
In plain English: 


=== PAGE {} ===
In the last half-hour before expiry, the market doesn't move in a straight line toward settlement. It 
*adjusts*—small jiggles up and down as traders scramble to exit, institutions unwind positions, 
and algorithms manage gamma risk. 
These adjustments create temporary gaps between Call and Put premiums at the ATM (At-The-
Money) strike. One side gets cheaper than it should be relative to the other. 
When you spot that gap, you buy the undervalued side and wait for the inevitable rebalance—
which happens within minutes. It's not about predicting direction. It's about exploiting the 
mechanical process of premium convergence to zero. 
 Why This Works in the Indian Market 
The NSE (National Stock Exchange) derivatives market has unique characteristics that make 
Adjustment Theory particularly effective: 
 1. Massive Volume Concentration in the Final Hour 
NSE data consistently shows that 30-50% of total expiry day volume occurs in the last 60 minutes. 
This liquidity surge creates volatility even when the index itself isn't moving much. 
 2. Retail Participation Spikes 
Indian retail traders (and let's be honest, many are gambling more than trading) pile into expiry 
day positions hoping for quick gains. This creates erratic order flow and premium dislocations. 
 3. Theta Acceleration 
Time decay doesn't happen linearly. In the final 30 minutes, theta goes parabolic. A premium worth 
₹10 at 3:00 PM might be ₹3 by 3:20 PM—even if spot hasn't moved. This acceleration creates the 
gaps Adjustment Theory exploits. 
 4. Auto Square-Off Pressures 
Most Indian brokers auto-square-off positions between 3:20-3:25 PM to avoid physical settlement 
complications. This creates predictable exit pressure that you can anticipate. 
 5. High Liquidity in Nifty/Bank Nifty ATM Strikes 
Unlike mid-cap stocks where liquidity dries up, Nifty and Bank Nifty ATM strikes maintain tight 
spreads and instant execution even at 3:14 PM. This is critical for scalping. 
Historical backtesting (via platforms like Sensibull and Opstra) shows 60-70% win rates for well-
executed Adjustment Theory trades on volatile expiries. 
 The Core Mechanics: How Adjustment Theory Works 


=== PAGE {} ===
Let's break down the step-by-step process: 
 Step 1: Timeframe and Market Setup 
Trading Window: 3:00 PM to 3:15 PM IST on expiry day 
- For Nifty:  (weekly/monthly expiry) 
- For Bank Nifty:  (weekly expiry) 
Why this specific window? 
Before 3:00 PM, there's still too much time left. Premiums haven't entered the extreme decay 
phase. After 3:15 PM, you're too close to auto-square-off and settlement risks. 
The 3:00-3:15 PM window is the sweet spot—enough time for micro-adjustments to create gaps, 
but not so much time that theta erosion dominates everything else. 
 Step 2: Strike Selection—The Expiring ATM Straddle 
At approximately 3:00 PM, identify where the index is likely to expire: 
- Check the spot price (e.g., Nifty at 24,998) 
- Identify the nearest ATM strike (25,000 in this case) 
- Focus on the ATM straddle: Same strike Call and Put 
  - 25,000 CE (Call) 
  - 25,000 PE (Put) 
Critical requirement: High Open Interest (OI) 
Don't trade illiquid strikes. You need instant execution and tight bid-ask spreads. The ATM strike 
on expiry day always has maximum liquidity—this is where the action happens. 
Use your broker's option chain (Zerodha, Upstox, Angel One, etc.) for real-time premium and OI 
data. 
 Step 3: Observing Premium Dynamics and Finding the Gap 
This is where the art meets the science. 
At 3:00 PM, note your baseline premiums: 


=== PAGE {} ===
Example: 
- 25,000 CE: ₹9 
- 25,000 PE: ₹12 
- Gap: ₹3 
Now watch what happens as the market adjusts. 
Scenario A: Market dips slightly 
- Spot ticks down to 24,990 
- 25,000 CE drops to ₹6 (calls lose value as spot moves away) 
- 25,000 PE rises to ₹15 (puts gain as spot approaches strike) 
- New gap: ₹9 
Scenario B: Market rallies slightly 
- Spot ticks up to 25,010 
- 25,000 CE rises to ₹13 
- 25,000 PE drops to ₹7 
- New gap: ₹6 
What you're looking for: A gap of ₹7-10 or more. 
When the gap widens significantly from the baseline, you've identified an imbalance. One side has 
been oversold (or overbought) relative to the other. 
This is your opportunity. 
 Step 4: Entry Logic 
Buy the undervalued leg—the one that got crushed disproportionately. 
In Scenario A: 
- The CE dropped from ₹9 to ₹6 while PE rose from ₹12 to ₹15 
- The CE is now undervalued relative to the straddle equilibrium 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Entry: Buy 25,000 CE at ₹6-7 
Why? Because as the market continues to adjust (jiggle back and forth), that CE premium will 
likely rebound toward ₹9-10 as spot mean-reverts or as traders rebalance positions. 
Execution tip: Use limit orders for better pricing, but don't be greedy. Speed matters more than 
saving ₹0.50. 
 Step 5: Risk Management (Non-Negotiable) 
Stop Loss: 20-30% below entry 
If you bought CE at ₹7, your stop loss is ₹5-5.50. 
Why so tight? Because you're trading in the final minutes. If the premium continues dropping 
instead of rebounding, you're wrong about the adjustment—exit immediately. 
Position Size: Small and Surgical 
Risk only 0.5-1% of your total capital per trade. 
Example: ₹5 lakh capital → Risk ₹2,500-5,000 per trade 
With premiums at ₹6-7 and lot size 25 (Nifty): 
- 1 lot cost: ₹7 × 25 = ₹175 
- Risk per lot (30% SL): ₹52.50 
- Maximum lots: ₹2,500 ÷ ₹52.50 ≈ 47 lots (but start with 10-20) 
Why small positions? 
Because you'll take multiple trades in the 15-minute window. It's about compounding small wins, 
not one massive bet. 
 Step 6: Target and Exit 
Target: 40-80% premium gain 
If you bought at ₹7, target ₹10-12. 
This might sound aggressive, but remember—premiums at ATM expiry strikes can swing 50-
100% in minutes due to gamma and spot oscillations. 
Time-based exit: No holding past 3:20 PM 


=== PAGE {} ===
Even if you haven't hit target, exit by 3:20 PM. Why? 
1. Auto-square-off risk from brokers (3:20-3:25 PM) 
2. Exponential theta decay in final 10 minutes 
3. Widening spreads as liquidity drains 
Better to take a small profit or small loss than get stuck in settlement. 
 Step 7: Rinse and Repeat 
Here's the beauty of Adjustment Theory: Multiple opportunities in one session. 
The market doesn't adjust once and settle. It adjusts, over-adjusts, corrects, adjusts again. Between 
3:00-3:15 PM, you might get 3-5 clear setups. 
Take them. Each successful scalp adds to your daily return. 
Target: 1-3% daily return per trade. Compound that across the month. 
 Why "Adjustment" Is the Perfect Name 
The market must 'adjust' during expiry to facilitate orderly decay and settlement. 
Think of it like a pendulum swinging back and forth before coming to rest. Each swing creates 
temporary imbalances. Those swings are your profit windows. 
But here's the critical insight most traders miss: 
The adjustments aren't random. They're driven by: 
1. Delta hedging by market makers (buying/selling underlying to stay neutral) 
2. Retail panic entries/exits (FOMO and fear in final minutes) 
3. Institutional unwinding (closing positions before settlement) 
4. Algorithmic rebalancing (gamma scalping bots) 
You're not predicting direction. You're identifying when the adjustment has *overshot* in one 
direction and betting on the mean-reversion snap-back. 
That's why tight stops are essential. If the adjustment doesn't revert, you're simply wrong about the 
timing—exit and wait for the next one.

 Example 1: Nifty Expiry Scalp on a Downward Adjustment 
Date: October 23, 2025 (Thursday, Nifty expiry)  
Time: 3:00 PM 
 Setup: 
- Nifty Spot: 24,998 
- Expiry Strike: 25,000 
- Baseline Premiums: 
  - 25,000 CE: ₹8 
  - 25,000 PE: ₹11 
  - Gap: ₹3 
 The Adjustment: 
By 3:05 PM, minor selling pressure pushes spot to 24,990. 
Premium update: 
- 25,000 CE: ₹5 (dropped ₹3) 
- 25,000 PE: ₹14 (rose ₹3) 
- New gap: ₹9 
 Analysis: 
The CE has been crushed disproportionately. The gap widened from ₹3 to ₹9—a clear imbalance. 
Entry decision: Buy 25,000 CE 
 Execution: 
- Entry: ₹5.50 (limit order filled) 
- Quantity: 1 lot (25 shares) 
- Investment: ₹5.50 × 25 = ₹137.50 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Stop loss: ₹4 (27% below entry) 
- Target: ₹10 (82% gain) 
 Outcome: 
By 3:10 PM, spot ticks back up to 25,010 (just a 20-point move, normal expiry jiggle). 
Premium rebound: 
- 25,000 CE: ₹10 
Exit: Sell at ₹10 
Profit: (₹10 - ₹5.50) × 25 = ₹112.50  
Return: 81.8% in 5 minutes  
Time held: 5 minutes 
 Key Takeaway: 
You didn't predict Nifty would rally. You identified that the CE was oversold relative to the 
straddle, and when the market adjusted back, you captured the rebound. 
 Example 2: Bank Nifty Expiry Play on an Upward Swing 
Date: Hypothetical Wednesday expiry  
Time: 3:02 PM 
 Setup: 
- Bank Nifty Spot: 48,002 
- Expiry Strike: 48,000 
- Baseline Premiums: 
  - 48,000 CE: ₹10 
  - 48,000 PE: ₹9 
  - Gap: ₹1 (nearly balanced) 
 The Adjustment: 


=== PAGE {} ===
Minor rally pushes spot to 48,025 by 3:07 PM. 
Premium update: 
- 48,000 CE: ₹15 (rose ₹5) 
- 48,000 PE: ₹6 (dropped ₹3) 
- New gap: ₹9 
 Analysis: 
The PE has been hammered. Gap widened from ₹1 to ₹9—clear overreaction. 
Entry decision: Buy 48,000 PE 
 Execution: 
- Entry: ₹6.50 
- Quantity: 1 lot (15 shares for Bank Nifty) 
- Investment: ₹6.50 × 15 = ₹97.50 
- Stop loss: ₹4.50 
- Target: ₹11 
 Outcome: 
By 3:12 PM, spot retreats slightly to 47,990 (35-point pullback). 
Premium rebound: 
- 48,000 PE: ₹11 
Exit: Sell at ₹11 
Profit: (₹11 - ₹6.50) × 15 = ₹67.50  
Return: 69.2% in 5 minutes 
 Key Takeaway: 
Bank Nifty is more volatile than Nifty, creating larger gaps and faster rebounds. Same principle, 
amplified results.

 Example 3: A Failed Trade and Recovery Strategy 
Date: October 23, 2025  
Time: 3:04 PM 
 Setup: 
- Nifty Spot: 25,000 
- Baseline: 
  - 25,000 CE: ₹7 
  - 25,000 PE: ₹13 
  - Gap: ₹6 
 The Adjustment 
Market dips; spot at 24,985. 
Premium update: 
- 25,000 CE: ₹4 
- 25,000 PE: ₹16 
- New gap: ₹12 
 Entry (Trade 1) 
Buy 25,000 CE at ₹4.50 
Expecting rebound as gap is extreme. 
 The Failure 
No rebound materializes. Selling pressure continues. By 3:09 PM: 
- 25,000 CE: ₹3 (continuing to decay) 
Stop loss triggered at ₹3.20 
Loss: (₹4.50 - ₹3.20) × 25 = ₹32.50  


=== PAGE {} ===
Loss %: 29% 
 The Recovery (Trade 2) 
After the failed CE trade, you observe the next adjustment. 
By 3:11 PM, spot rebounds to 25,005. 
New premium reality: 
- 25,000 CE: ₹11 (now rebounded after you exited—painful!) 
- 25,000 PE: ₹8 (now crushed) 
- Gap shifted 
 Entry Decision 
Buy 25,000 PE at ₹8 
The pendulum has swung. Now PE is undervalued. 
 Execution 
- Entry: ₹8 
- Target: ₹12 
- Stop loss: ₹5.50 
 Outcome 
Spot consolidates around 25,000. PE premium rebounds to ₹11.50 by 3:16 PM. 
Exit: ₹11.50 
Profit: (₹11.50 - ₹8) × 25 = ₹87.50  
Return: 43.75% 
 Session Summary 
- Trade 1 (CE): Loss of ₹32.50 
- Trade 2 (PE): Profit of ₹87.50 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Net: +₹55 (after commissions/taxes, approximately +₹40) 
 Key Takeaway 
Not every Adjustment Theory trade works. That's why you need: 
1. Tight stop losses to limit damage 
2. Willingness to take multiple trades in the session 
3. Emotional discipline to re-enter after a loss 
One winning trade can offset 2-3 small losses. That's the mathematical edge. 
 Critical Success Factors 
 1. Speed of Execution 
In the final 15 minutes, seconds matter. Have your option chain open, fingers on the keyboard, 
orders ready. 
Pre-set alerts for premium levels if your broker supports it. 
 2. Understanding Greeks (Light Touch) 
You don't need to calculate delta/gamma manually, but understand: 
- Delta: How much premium changes with spot movement 
- Gamma: How quickly delta changes (highest at ATM) 
- Theta: Time decay acceleration 
At ATM expiry strikes, gamma is maximum, meaning premiums swing violently with small spot 
moves—this is what creates your opportunities. 
 3. Avoiding False Gaps 
Not every gap is tradeable. Avoid: 
- Gaps smaller than ₹5-6 (not worth the risk) 
- Gaps that widen further after entry (you're catching a falling knife) 
- Low-volume strikes (illiquid = execution risk) 


=== PAGE {} ===
 4. The Straddle Shift Risk 
This is the biggest danger in Adjustment Theory: 
If spot moves decisively and the expiry strike *shifts* (e.g., from 25,000 to 24,900), the OTM 
option you're holding will evaporate instantly. 
Example: You bought 25,000 CE expecting rebound, but spot crashes to 24,850. Suddenly 25,000 
is deep OTM. Your CE goes to ₹0.05 before you can exit. 
Protection: Stop loss is mandatory. No exceptions. 
 Risks and Operational Considerations 
 Transaction Costs: 
- STT (Securities Transaction Tax): 0.125% on option sells (sell side only) 
- Brokerage: Most discount brokers charge ₹20 per executed order 
- GST: 18% on brokerage 
- Exchange charges: Minimal but present 
Factor these in. A ₹50 profit might become ₹35 after costs. 
 Auto Square-Off: 
Brokers like Zerodha, Upstox, Angel One have different square-off times (typically 3:20-3:25 
PM). Know your broker's policy. 
Getting stuck in positions post-3:25 PM can lead to forced physical settlement—extremely 
complicated and costly. 
 Emotional Pressure: 
Trading the final 15 minutes of expiry is intense. Heart-pounding. Adrenaline-fueled. 
If you can't handle stress, this strategy isn't for you. 
Practice on paper first. Simulate the environment. Build tolerance. 
 Days to Avoid: 
- Low-volume holidays (post-Diwali lull, summer Fridays) 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Major event days (Budget, RBI policy—premiums behave irrationally) 
- Days with circuit breakers or exchange issues 
Quality over quantity. Trade only clean, high-liquidity expiries. 
 Combining with Other Tools. Option Chain Analysis. Use heat maps to visualize OI 
concentration. Max pain levels can indicate where the market wants to settle—useful for gauging 
adjustment direction. 
 VIX (Volatility Index) 
High VIX (>20) means larger premium swings—more opportunity but also more risk. Low VIX 
(<15) means tighter gaps—harder to profit. 
 Footprint/Order Flow (Advanced) 
If you have access to order flow data, watch for large institutional buy/sell orders in the final 
minutes. They often trigger the adjustments you're exploiting. 
 The Berlin Approach to Adjustment Theory: 
When I (Berlin) first discovered Adjustment Theory, I lost money for three weeks straight. 
Why? Because I was impatient. I'd see a ₹4 gap and jump in, then watch it widen to ₹8 as premiums 
continued decaying. 
What changed? 
I started 'waiting' for the gap to stabilize or even reverse slightly before entering. That extra 30 
seconds of confirmation reduced my losing trades by 40%. 
I also learned to embrace multiple small wins rather than swinging for one big score. Three trades 
at ₹50 profit each beats one trade aiming for ₹200 that never materializes. 
Adjustment Theory isn't about being right every time. It's about being disciplined every time. 
 Final Words: Your Expiry Day Edge 
The last 15 minutes of expiry day will always be chaos. 
Most traders see chaos and panic. 
You, armed with Adjustment Theory, see patterns. Imbalances. Opportunities. 


=== PAGE {} ===
While they're gambling on random OTM strikes hoping for 10x miracles, you're systematically 
scalping 40-80% returns from mechanical premium convergence. 
This is your edge. But it requires: 
Practice (simulate 20+ expiries before going live)  
Discipline (follow the entry/exit rules religiously)  
Speed (execution in seconds, not minutes)  
Emotional control (accept losses, move to next setup)  
Small positions (compound wins, don't blow up on one bad trade) 
Start small. Log every trade. Review your execution. Refine your gap thresholds. Build muscle 
memory. 
In six months, while others are still frozen at 3:05 PM wondering what to do, you'll be calmly 
executing your third profitable scalp of the session. 
That's the power of Adjustment Theory. 
The market adjusts. You adjust with it. And you get paid for the precision. 
P.S. — The first time you successfully execute Adjustment Theory and bank ₹5,000 in eight 
minutes, you'll feel like you've unlocked a cheat code. You haven't. You've just learned to see what 
was always there. Now go practice.

The Big Money Theory 
Following the Elephants' Footprints to Profit 
 The 3:05 PM Heartbreak 
It's expiry day. 3:05 PM. 
You've been watching Bank Nifty 49800 CE all afternoon. It was at ₹260 earlier in the day—you 
saw it, you thought about buying it, but you hesitated. "Too expensive," you told yourself. 
Now, in the final minutes before expiry, that same option is at ₹48. 
And suddenly—'boom'—it explodes. ₹48... ₹75... ₹110... ₹185. In less than ten minutes. 
You watch, paralyzed, as traders in your Telegram group post screenshots: 
"Bought at 52, sold at 160. 3x return in 8 minutes!  
"Entry at 48, still holding at 190. This is printing money!  
Meanwhile, you're sitting there with nothing. You missed it. Again. 
But here's the question that haunts you as you close your laptop: 
How did they know? How did they know to buy at ₹48? What were they seeing that I wasn't? 
If this scenario feels painfully familiar, you're about to discover something that will fundamentally 
change how you approach expiry day trading. 
You weren't missing some magical indicator. You weren't lacking technical analysis skills. 
You were missing the footprints. 
The footprints of Big Money—the institutional players, the whales, the ones who moved that 
option from ₹48 to ₹260 in the first place. 
Welcome to The Big Money Theory. 
 What Is The Big Money Theory? 
Let me give you Berlin's definition: 


=== PAGE {} ===
The Big Money Theory is a strategy of identifying where institutional money (the "elephants") 
accumulated large positions in options, and entering at those same zones on expiry day when 
premiums return there, betting that the elephants will defend or re-enter those levels. 
In simpler terms: Big players—institutions, hedge funds, proprietary traders with crores in 
capital—don't just randomly buy options. When they decide to build a position, they do it 
systematically at specific price levels. These are called "accumulation zones." When an option that 
spiked to ₹260 comes back down to ₹48-50 (where it was originally accumulated), that's not 
random. That's a gravitational pull back to where the big money entered. 
And that's your opportunity. 
The Big Money Theory says: Follow the elephants. Enter where they entered. Ride when they ride. 
Exit when momentum dies. It's not about predicting. It's about tracking, identifying, and 
piggybacking on institutional order flow. 
 Understanding the Key Concepts 
Before we dive into the strategy mechanics, you need to understand the vocabulary of big money 
movement. 
 Block Orders: The Elephant's Footprints 
What is a block order? 
A block order is a large single transaction—typically 10,000+ contracts—executed by institutional 
players. These orders are big enough to move premiums significantly. 
When you see an option premium suddenly jump from ₹45 to ₹80 in a few minutes without 
corresponding massive spot movement, that's likely a block order. 
Why do institutions use block orders? 
Because they're building positions too large to enter gradually. They *need* to buy 50,000 or 
100,000 contracts, and they need to do it in a narrow price range before the market catches on and 
premiums spike. 
How do you spot them? 
In real-time, you'll see: 
- Sudden, sharp premium increases (20-50% jumps) 
- High volume spikes in the option chain 
- Increase in open interest (OI) at specific strikes 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Premium holding elevated levels despite minor spot pullbacks 
Think of it like this: If you're walking on a beach and see normal footprints, that's retail. But if you 
see a crater in the sand, something massive just walked through. That's a block order. 
 Accumulation Zone: Where Elephants Gather 
What is an accumulation zone? 
The accumulation zone is the price range where big money systematically built their position 
before the major move. 
It's characterized by: 
- Premiums trading in a tight range (e.g., ₹45-52) 
- Increasing OI without massive premium movement (they're buying quietly) 
- Consolidation before the explosion 
Example: 
Bank Nifty 60800 CE timeline: 
- 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM: Premium trades between ₹45-52 (accumulation zone) 
- 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM: Premium explodes to ₹260 (the move) 
- 2:30 PM - 3:10 PM: Premium decays back toward ₹50 (return to accumulation zone) 
That ₹45-52 range is your accumulation zone. 
Why does this matter? Because when premiums return to that zone on expiry day, you're 
essentially entering at the same price the elephants did—with the same potential for explosive 
moves if they re-activate their positions or defend that level. 
 The Expiry Day Phenomenon 
Why does Big Money Theory work specifically on expiry days? 
Three reasons: 
1. Accelerated Time Decay 
Premiums collapse rapidly in the final hours. Options that were ₹260 can fall to ₹50 within hours 
purely due to theta, bringing them back to accumulation zones quickly. 


=== PAGE {} ===
2. High Volatility Creates Opportunities 
The whipsaw movements on expiry day cause premiums to spike and crash repeatedly, creating 
multiple re-entries into accumulation zones. 
3. Settlement Pressure 
Institutional players need to either defend their strikes (to avoid losses) or capitalize on built 
positions. This creates predictable price action at key levels—including accumulation zones. 
Bottom line: Expiry day is when premiums become elastic enough to snap back to where big 
money originally entered, giving you the chance to follow. 
 The Big Money Theory Strategy: Step-by-Step Breakdown 
Now let's get into the actual mechanics of how to execute this. 
 Step 1: Identify the Accumulation Zone (Before Expiry Day) 
This happens on ex-d1 or ex-d2 (one or two days before expiry). 
Watch for options that: 
- Trade in a tight range for extended periods (1-3 hours) 
- Show increasing OI without proportional premium increase 
- Suddenly explode 3-5x in premium 
Example: Bank Nifty 60800 CE 
Tuesday 11 AM - 2 PM: Premium ₹45-52, OI increases by 15,000 contracts  
Tuesday 2:15 PM: Premium suddenly at ₹180  
Tuesday 2:45 PM: Premium peaks at ₹260 
Your accumulation zone: ₹48-52 
Mark this down. This is where the elephants entered. 
 
 Step 2: Wait for Expiry Day Retest 
On expiry day (ex-d0), monitor that same option. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Due to time decay and market oscillations, premiums often retrace significantly. What was ₹260 
might come back to ₹80, ₹60, or even ₹48-52. 
You're waiting for the premium to return to or near the accumulation zone. 
This typically happens: 
- During mid-day consolidation (11 AM - 1 PM) 
- In the pre-final hour (2:00 PM - 2:45 PM) 
- In the final scramble (3:00 PM - 3:15 PM) 
 
 Step 3: Entry at the Accumulation Zone 
When the premium touches your accumulation zone (₹48-52 in our example), you enter. 
Entry parameters: 
- Price: ₹48-52 (the accumulation zone) 
- Stop Loss: ₹38-42 (approximately ₹10-15 below entry) 
- Target: ₹96-104 (100% return) or ₹120-130 (150% return) 
- Position size: Risk only 5% of your capital on this trade 
Why this works: 
When premiums return to accumulation zones, one of two things happens: 
Scenario A (65% probability): The zone acts as support. Big money defends it or fresh buyers 
enter. Premium rebounds—potentially explosively if spot momentum aligns. 
Scenario B (35% probability): The zone fails. Premium continues decaying. Your stop loss protects 
you. 
With proper risk-reward (risking ₹10-15 for ₹50-100 gain), you only need to win 35-40% of trades 
to be profitable. 
 
 Step 4: Risk Management (The 80% of Success) 


=== PAGE {} ===
Berlin's mantra: "It's 20% strategy and 80% risk management." 
Here's the non-negotiable framework: 
Stop Loss Discipline 
If premium falls ₹10-15 below your entry, exit immediately. No hope. No "let me give it a few 
more minutes." The zone failed. Move on. 
Position Sizing 
Risk maximum 5% of your capital per trade. 
Example: ₹5 lakh capital → ₹25,000 max risk per trade 
If your stop loss is ₹10 on a ₹50 entry (20% loss): 
- Position size = ₹25,000 ÷ ₹10 = ₹2,500 worth of options 
- At ₹50 per option = 50 contracts (approximately, depending on lot size) 
Maximum Trades Per Day 
No more than 2 entries per day. Why? To prevent overtrading and emotional decision-making after 
losses. 
Time-Based Exit 
If you haven't hit target or stop loss by 3:20 PM, exit. Don't risk settlement complications. 
 Step 5: Let Winners Ride 
This is where most traders fail and where Big Money Theory either works spectacularly or just 
"works okay." 
When your trade moves in your favor: 
At 50% profit (₹75 on ₹50 entry): 
- Move stop loss to breakeven (₹50) 
- Hold remaining position 
At 100% profit (₹100): 
- Book 50% of position 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Trail stop loss to ₹75 on remaining 50% 
If momentum continues: 
- Let the remaining 50% run to 150%, 200%, even 300% 
- Keep trailing stop loss 
Why this matters: 
Your win rate is ~65%. That means 3.5 losses for every 6.5 wins out of 10 trades. 
If you take ₹10 losses 3.5 times, you lose ₹35.  
If you take ₹50 gains 6.5 times by cutting winners early, you make ₹325.  
Net: ₹290 profit 
But if you let just 2-3 of those winners run to 100-150%:  
3 trades at ₹50 gain = ₹150  
3 trades at ₹100 gain = ₹300  
0.5 trades at ₹150 gain = ₹75  
Total: ₹525 against ₹35 in losses = ₹490 profit 
That's a 69% improvement just by letting winners ride. 
This is why Berlin says: "Cut losses short and let winners ride." 
 
 Real Examples Breakdown 
Let's walk through Berlin's actual examples to cement your understanding. 
 Example 1: Bank Nifty 60800 CE 
Setup: 
- Accumulation zone identified: ₹48-52 
- On expiry day, premium retraces from ₹180 down to ₹50 


=== PAGE {} ===
Entry: 
- Price: ₹50 
- Stop Loss: ₹38 (₹12 risk) 
- Target 1: ₹100 (100% gain) 
- Target 2: ₹125 (150% gain) 
- Position: 100 contracts (lot size adjusted) 
- Capital at risk: 5% = ₹25,000 
Trade Progression: 
2:35 PM - Enter at ₹50  
2:42 PM - Premium at ₹68 (+36%)  
2:48 PM - Premium at ₹85 (+70%)  
2:55 PM - Premium hits ₹100 → Book 50 contracts  
3:05 PM - Premium spikes to ₹145 → Exit remaining 50 contracts  
Result: 
- 50 contracts: (₹100 - ₹50) × 50 = ₹2,500 profit 
- 50 contracts: (₹145 - ₹50) × 50 = ₹4,750 profit 
- Total: ₹7,250 profit on ₹5,000 invested (145% return) 
Key Takeaway: The accumulation zone held as support. Big money defended the level, and the 
premium exploded in the final minutes. 
 
 Example 2: Bank Nifty 61300 CE 
Setup: 
- Accumulation zone: ₹13-15 
- Much tighter zone, smaller premium 


=== PAGE {} ===
Entry: 
- Price: ₹14 
- Stop Loss: ₹9 (₹5 risk) 
- Target: ₹28 (100% gain) 
Trade Progression: 
1:15 PM - Enter at ₹14  
1:28 PM - Premium at ₹19 (+35%)  
1:45 PM - Premium drops to ₹12 (getting close to SL)  
2:10 PM - Premium recovers to ₹22  
2:35 PM - Premium hits ₹30 → Exit  
Result: 
- ₹16 profit per contract (114% return) 
Key Takeaway: The trade tested your conviction—it came dangerously close to stop loss before 
rebounding. This is normal. Respect your stop loss, but don't exit prematurely out of fear. 
 
 Example 3: MidCap Nifty 13100 PE 
Setup: 
- Accumulation zone: ₹22-25 
- Put option during bearish phase 
Entry: 
- Price: ₹24 
- Stop Loss: ₹12 (₹12 risk) 
- Target: ₹48 (100% gain) 
Trade Progression: 


=== PAGE {} ===
11:05 AM - Enter at ₹24  
11:30 AM - Premium decays to ₹18 (theta eating value)  
12:15 PM - Spot drops, premium spikes to ₹45  
12:25 PM - Book 50% at ₹45  
12:40 PM - Premium hits ₹65 → Exit remaining  
Result: 
- 50%: ₹21 gain (87.5%) 
- 50%: ₹41 gain (170%) 
- Average: 128% return 
Key Takeaway: Even though premium decayed initially (theta), the zone held, and when spot 
moved favorably, premium exploded. Patience paid. 
 
 Example 4: MidCap Nifty 13200 PE (The Failed Trade) 
Setup: 
- Accumulation zone: ₹45-48 
Entry: 
- Price: ₹46 
- Stop Loss: ₹33 
Trade Progression: 
2:10 PM - Enter at ₹46  
2:18 PM - Premium at ₹39  
2:25 PM - Premium at ₹34  
2:28 PM - Stop loss triggered at ₹33  
Result: 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Loss: ₹13 per contract (28% loss) 
Key Takeaway: Not every accumulation zone holds. The zone failed, big money didn't defend it, 
and you took your loss. This is the 35% of trades that lose. It's part of the game. 
What matters: You didn't hold hoping for recovery. You didn't average down. You respected your 
stop loss and preserved capital for the next trade. 
Berlin claims a 65% success rate with this strategy. 
That means: 
- Out of 10 trades, you win 6-7 
- Out of 10 trades, you lose 3-4 
This is actually excellent. Most strategies hover around 50-55%. 
But here's the critical part: Win rate alone doesn't determine profitability. Risk-reward ratio does. 
 Scenario A: Bad Risk Management 
10 trades: 
- 6 wins at ₹50 profit each = ₹300 
- 4 losses at ₹50 loss each = ₹200 
- Net: ₹100 profit (meh) 
 Scenario B: Cutting Winners Short 
10 trades: 
- 6 wins at ₹30 profit (you exited too early) = ₹180 
- 4 losses at ₹15 loss (you honored SL) = ₹60 
- Net: ₹120 profit (barely worth the effort) 
 Scenario C: Berlin's Approach 
10 trades: 
- 3 wins at ₹50 (solid gains, exited at target) = ₹150 


=== PAGE {} ===
- 2 wins at ₹100 (let winners ride to 100%) = ₹200 
- 1 win at ₹150 (caught a runner) = ₹150 
- 4 losses at ₹15 = ₹60 
- Net: ₹440 profit (this is life-changing over time) 
The difference? Letting winners ride while cutting losses short. 
This is the 80% risk management component Berlin talks about. 
 The Rules: Your Big Money Theory Commandments 
Berlin's framework is clear. Follow these rules religiously: 
 Rule 1: Trade Only on Expiry Days 
Accumulation zones work best when premiums are elastic (expiry day). On regular days, 
premiums don't retrace enough to zones. 
 Rule 2: Maximum 2 Entries Per Day 
Prevents overtrading. Prevents emotional revenge trading after losses. Forces selectivity. 
 Rule 3: Risk 5% Maximum Per Trade 
Protects capital. Even 3 consecutive losses = 15% drawdown (recoverable). Breaking this rule can 
wipe you out. 
 Rule 4: Never Hold Losses 
If stop loss hits, exit. No exceptions. No "one more minute." The zone failed. Accept it. Move on. 
 Rule 5: Respect Risk-Reward 
If you set a 1:2 or 1:5 target, hold for it. Don't book at 1:0.5 because you're nervous. Trust your 
plan. 
 Rule 6: Don't Overtrade to Recover Losses 
Lost two trades? Don't take a third to "make it back." Stop for the day. Reset tomorrow. Revenge 
trading kills accounts. 
 Rule 7: Ride Winners 


=== PAGE {} ===
This is the hardest rule and the most profitable. Book partial profits, then let the rest run. This is 
how you fund all your losses and still come out massively ahead. 
 Why Big Money Theory Works in the Indian Market? 
The NSE derivatives market is uniquely suited for this strategy: 
 1. High Institutional Participation 
FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors) and DIIs (Domestic Institutional Investors) actively trade 
Nifty and Bank Nifty options with massive positions. Their footprints are visible. 
 2. Expiry Day Liquidity 
India has weekly expiries on major indices. Every Thursday (Nifty) and Wednesday (Bank Nifty), 
volumes spike 2-3x, creating the conditions for accumulation zone retests. 
 3. Max Pain Dynamics 
Indian options markets show strong max pain effects—the market gravitates toward strikes with 
maximum OI. Accumulation zones often align with or near max pain levels, adding confluence. 
 4. Retail Over-Reaction 
When premiums spike, Indian retail traders FOMO in. When premiums crash, they panic out. This 
volatility creates the retracements to accumulation zones that big money capitalizes on—and so 
can you. 
 Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them 
 Mistake 1: Entering Too Early 
Seeing an accumulation zone and entering while premium is still at ₹80 (when zone is ₹48-52). 
Solution: Wait for actual retest of the zone. Patience beats premature entry every time. 
 Mistake 2: Ignoring Stop Loss 
Premium drops to ₹35 (your SL was ₹38), but you hold hoping for recovery. 
Solution: Set alerts. Use GTT orders. Make exit automatic, not emotional. 
 Mistake 3: Taking Profits Too Early 
Premium hits ₹70 (40% gain), and you exit entirely, missing the run to ₹150. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Solution: Use the 50/50 rule—book half, let half ride with trailing stop. 
 Mistake 4: Trading Too Many Strikes 
Trying Big Money Theory on 5 different options simultaneously. 
Solution: Focus on 1-2 high-liquidity strikes per day (typically Bank Nifty or Nifty ATM/OTM). 
 Mistake 5: Ignoring Time Decay 
Entering at 2:00 PM when theta is brutal, expecting premium to hold. 
Solution: Favor entries between 11 AM - 2 PM or final 30 minutes (3:00-3:20 PM) when volatility 
can overcome theta. 
 The Psychological Edge: Trading Like Big Money 
Here's what most retail traders don't understand: 
Big money isn't smarter than you. They just have different advantages: 
1. Capital: They can defend positions retail can't 
2. Information: They see order flow retail doesn't 
3. Discipline: They execute systems without emotion 
Big Money Theory lets you borrow two of those three advantages: 
You gain information by identifying their accumulation zones (you see where they entered). 
You gain discipline by following a rule-based system (enter at zones, stop at SL, ride winners). 
You can't match their capital, but you don't need to. You need to follow their footprints and 
piggyback on their conviction. 
When you enter at ₹50 because that's where they accumulated, you're essentially saying: "I trust 
that elephants know where the waterhole is better than I do." 
And most of the time? They do. 
 Your First Big Money Theory Trade 
Here's how to start: 
This Week (Practice): 


=== PAGE {} ===
1. Watch Nifty/Bank Nifty options on ex-d1 (Wednesday for Bank Nifty, Wednesday for Nifty) 
2. Note any options that spike 3-5x and identify accumulation zones 
3. On expiry day, watch those zones—but don't trade yet 
4. Paper trade: Note where you would have entered, what your SL would be, and track the result 
5. Log it 
Next Week (Small Position): 
1. Repeat observation 
2. If a premium retests accumulation zone, enter with 1% risk (not 5%) 
3. Follow rules religiously 
4. Exit at SL or target 
5. Log and review 
Month 2 (Full Implementation): 
1. Increase to 2-3% risk per trade 
2. Maximum 2 trades per day 
3. Track win rate and average risk-reward 
4. After 20 trades, evaluate if your execution matches the 65% win rate 
If yes, scale to 5% risk. If no, refine your zone identification or entry timing. 
 The Berlin Promise 
"I'm going to tell you something that might sound arrogant, but it's backed by data: If you follow 
Big Money Theory with discipline for 3 months—properly identifying zones, respecting stop losses, 
and letting winners ride—you will be profitable." 
Not because the strategy is perfect. Not because every trade works. But because the math works. 
65% win rate + proper risk-reward + letting winners ride = inevitable profitability. 
The only way you lose with this system is by breaking the rules: 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Entering outside accumulation zones (no edge) 
- Ignoring stop losses (catastrophic losses) 
- Cutting winners too early (no funding for losses) 
- Overtrading (emotional decision-making) 
Follow the rules. Track the elephants. Profit from their footprints. 
It's that simple. And it works. 
P.S. — The next time you see an option spike 5x and think "I missed it," remember: You didn't 
miss it. You're just watching the elephants gather. Now you know where they'll return. And when 
they do, you'll be waiting.

Money Management 
The One Skill That Separates Survivors from Casualties 
 The ₹70 Lakh Confession narrated by Berlin 
Let me tell you something that most traders will never admit publicly. I lost ₹70 lakhs in 72 days. 
That's roughly ₹1 lakh per day. Every single day for over two months, my account bled. Red. 
Relentless. Ruthless. You know what the strangest part was? I wasn't panicking. My family asked, 
"Berlin, are you okay? You seem... calm." 
My friends said, "Man, if I lost that much, I'd be destroyed. How are you still trading?" Even 
people in my trading group were concerned: "Bro, take a break. This is brutal." But here's what 
they didn't understand what most traders 'never' understand until it's too late: I wasn't focused on 
the ₹70 lakhs I lost. I was focused on the foundation I was building. 
Because here's the truth nobody wants to hear: Losing money in trading is inevitable. But how you 
manage that money—how you protect your capital, how you preserve your psychological stability, 
how you ensure you're still in the game when the winning streak arrives—that's what determines 
whether you become wealthy or become a cautionary tale. 
This article isn't about strategies. It's not about indicators or chart patterns. This is about money 
management—the most unglamorous, most ignored, and most critical skill in trading. And if you 
don't master it? Everything else you learn is worthless. 
 The Indian Trading Trap: Why 90% Fail? 
Let's address the elephant in the room. 
The Indian derivatives market—particularly F&O trading on Nifty and Bank Nifty—has one of 
the highest retail participation rates globally. Over 90% of NSE's trading volume comes from 
derivatives. That should be exciting, right? So many people trading, so much opportunity! 
Except here's the brutal statistic: 95% of retail traders lose money in F&O. Not just 
"underperform"—they lose. Their accounts shrink. They withdraw. They quit. 
Why? 
Not because they lack intelligence. Not because they can't read charts. Not because they don't have 
access to information. They fail because they have zero concept of money management. 
 The ₹5 Lakh Starting Capital Syndrome: 
Here's how it typically goes: 


=== PAGE {} ===
Month 1: 
Raj opens a trading account with ₹5 lakhs. He's read books. He's watched YouTube videos. He's 
joined three Telegram channels. He's ready. 
First trade: He buys Nifty 25,000 CE with ₹1 lakh (20% of capital). It moves in his favor. He exits 
at ₹1.4 lakhs. 
Profit: ₹40,000 in one day. 
He thinks: *"This is easy! If I can make ₹40K in a day, I can make ₹8 lakhs in a month!"* 
Month 2: 
Emboldened, he increases position size. Next trade: ₹2 lakhs in Bank Nifty puts. It goes against 
him. Loss: ₹60,000. 
He thinks: *"One bad trade. I'll recover."* 
Next trade: ₹2.5 lakhs to make back the loss. Another loss: ₹80,000. 
Now he's down ₹1.4 lakhs from his peak. Panic sets in. 
Month 3: 
Desperate to recover, he goes all-in on a "sure shot" trade someone posted in a group. ₹3 lakhs. 
Market gaps against him overnight. 
Loss: ₹2.1 lakhs. 
His ₹5 lakh account is now ₹2.6 lakhs. 
He's lost nearly 50% of his capital in three months. 
Month 4: 
Demoralized, emotional, desperate, he makes increasingly reckless trades. By month-end, his 
account is at ₹80,000. He quits. Tells everyone "trading is gambling." Blames the system, market 
manipulation, his broker, anything except the real culprit: Complete absence of money 
management. 
 What Raj Should Have Done: The 1-2% Rule. 
Let me rewrite Raj's story with proper money management. 
Month 1 (With Discipline): 


=== PAGE {} ===
Capital: ₹5 lakhs 
Maximum risk per trade: 2% = ₹10,000 
First trade: He identifies a setup. Based on his risk (₹10,000) and stop loss distance, he calculates 
position size. Let's say his stop loss is 20% below entry. 
That means: ₹10,000 ÷ 0.20 = ₹50,000 position size (10% of capital) 
He enters. Trade goes in his favor. 30% gain. 
Profit: ₹15,000 
Not as exciting as ₹40,000, but here's the difference: If he was wrong, he'd only lose ₹10,000 (2% 
of capital). 
He takes 5 trades that month: 
- 3 winners: ₹15K, ₹12K, ₹18K = ₹45,000 
- 2 losers: ₹10K, ₹10K = ₹20,000 
Net: +₹25,000 (5% monthly return) 
His capital is now ₹5.25 lakhs. 
Month 2-3: 
He continues the same approach. Some months are better (8-10% return), some are worse (2-3% 
return), and one month he's flat (0%). 
By Month 3, his capital is approximately ₹5.65 lakhs (13% growth in 3 months). 
Month 4: 
He's still in the game. Still learning. Still compounding. 
Where's the original Raj? Out of the market with an 84% loss. 
This disciplined Raj? On his way to building something sustainable. 
 The Foundation Metaphor: Why I Brought Up the Eiffel Tower? 
When I was bleeding ₹70 lakhs, someone asked me: "Berlin, when will you stop? When will you 
accept this isn't working?" 


=== PAGE {} ===
I told them about the Eiffel Tower. 
The Eiffel Tower took 2 years, 2 months, and 5 days to complete. 
For most of that time, all people saw was construction chaos—metal beams, scaffolding, noise, 
apparent disorder. People criticized it. Called it an eyesore. Said it would fail. But the engineers 
knew something the critics didn't: They were building a foundation strong enough to support 
10,000 tons of iron, rising 300 meters into the sky, withstanding winds and time for over 130 years. 
The foundation took the longest. The foundation was the least glamorous. But the foundation was 
everything. 
That's what those 72 days were for me. 
I wasn't just losing money. I was: 
- Testing position sizing under extreme volatility 
- Building emotional resilience to handle drawdowns 
- Refining my risk management protocols 
- Learning which strategies survived market stress and which collapsed 
- Developing the psychological strength to take the next trade after ten consecutive losses 
The ₹70 lakh loss was the cost of my foundation. And you know what happened after those 72 
days? 
The next 90 days, I made ₹1.2 crores. Not because the market suddenly became easy. But because 
my foundation was now unshakable. The Core Principle: Focus on What You Keep, Not What 
You Make. 
Here's the mindset shift that changes everything: 
Amateur traders ask: "How much can I make today?" 
Professional traders ask: "How much am I willing to lose today?" 
Let me illustrate with two traders: 
 Trader A (The Gunslinger) 
- Makes ₹5 lakhs in a good month 
- Loses ₹4 lakhs in a bad month 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Annual pattern: ₹5L, -₹4L, ₹6L, -₹5L, ₹7L, -₹6L, ₹4L, -₹3L, ₹5L, -₹4L, ₹6L, -₹5L 
- Year-end result: +₹12 lakhs on ₹50 lakh capital (24% return) 
Sounds impressive, right? 
 Trader B (The Foundation Builder) 
- Makes ₹2 lakhs in a good month 
- Loses ₹50,000 in a bad month 
- Annual pattern: ₹2L, ₹1.5L, ₹2L, -₹0.5L, ₹2L, ₹1.8L, ₹2L, -₹0.5L, ₹2L, ₹1.5L, ₹2L, ₹1.8L 
- Year-end result: +₹18.6 lakhs on ₹50 lakh capital (37.2% return) 
Trader B makes significantly more despite lower monthly highs. 
Why? Because Trader B protects capital during drawdowns. Those -₹4L, -₹5L, -₹6L months kill 
Trader A's compounding. It's not about the lakhs you make in a month. It's about the lakhs you 
keep at the end of the year. The 1% Daily Target: Boring, But Brutal. Let me show you some math 
that will change your perspective. 
Starting capital: ₹10 lakhs 
Target: 1% daily return 
Trading days per year: ~250 (accounting for weekends, holidays) 
Most traders scoff at this: "Only 1%? That's just ₹10,000! I want ₹50,000 per day!" 
Here's what they don't understand: 
 Year 1: 
- Daily return: 1% = ₹10,000/day 
- After compounding: ₹10L grows to approximately ₹25L 
- Absolute return: 150% 
 
 Year 2: 
- Starting capital: ₹25L 


=== PAGE {} ===
- Daily return: 1% = ₹25,000/day (2.5x higher than Year 1) 
- After compounding: ₹25L grows to approximately ₹62.5L 
- Absolute return: 150% 
 
 Year 3: 
- Starting capital: ₹62.5L 
- Daily return: 1% = ₹62,500/day 
- After compounding: ₹62.5L grows to approximately ₹1.56 crores 
- You're now making ₹1.56 lakh per day at the same 1% rate 
In three years, a disciplined 1% daily return turns ₹10 lakhs into ₹1.56 crores. 
But here's the catch: To achieve this, you must protect your capital ruthlessly. One catastrophic 
loss resets the clock. This is why money management isn't optional. It's the entire game. 
 
 The Drawdown Reality: Acceptance Is Power 
Every trader will face drawdowns. Not "might"—will. 
The Nifty crashed 38% in March 2020. It corrected 8% in May 2022. It dropped 6% in October 
2023. If you're trading, you will experience losses. Multiple in a row. For weeks. Sometimes 
months. The question isn't whether you'll face drawdowns. The question is: Will you survive them? 
 My ₹70 Lakh Drawdown: The Breakdown 
Those 72 days weren't random bad luck. They were a confluence of: 
1. Testing new strategies under live conditions (some failed) 
2. Increased position sizing at the wrong time (learned to scale gradually) 
3. Market regime change (trend-following strategies stopped working in choppy volatility) 
4. Emotional overtrading after initial losses (the revenge trading trap) 
But here's what saved me: 


=== PAGE {} ===
I never risked more than 3% of my capital on a single trade. Even during the worst stretches, I 
never had a single trade that wiped out 10-15% of my account. If I had been risking 10% per trade 
(which many traders do), a series of 7-8 losses would have blown up my account completely. 
Instead, my worst single-day loss was ₹2.8 lakhs on a ₹50 lakh account (5.6%). Painful, but 
survivable. That's the power of money management. It doesn't prevent losses. It prevents 
catastrophe. 
 The Recovery Trap: Fast vs. Slow 
After a drawdown, there are two types of recoveries: 
 Retracement Volume Recovery (The Trap) 
You're down ₹10 lakhs. You get desperate. You increase position sizes aggressively to "make it 
back fast." 
You get lucky—market moves in your favor for a week. You recover ₹8 lakhs. 
Then the next week, it reverses. You lose ₹12 lakhs because your positions are too large. 
You're now down ₹14 lakhs—worse than before. 
This is "retracement volume" recovery—fast, emotional, unsustainable. It's like a dead cat bounce 
in price charts. Looks promising but collapses. 
 Whole Volume Recovery (The Foundation) 
You're down ₹10 lakhs. You 'reduce' position sizes. You focus on rebuilding confidence and 
consistency. 
You target small, steady gains—₹25K, ₹40K, ₹30K per week. Some weeks you're flat or slightly 
negative. 
But over 3-4 months, you grind back to breakeven, then positive. This recovery sticks because it's 
built on process, not desperation. 
When I lost ₹70 lakhs, I didn't try to make it back in one month. I gave myself six months to 
recover psychologically and strategically. The actual recovery took four months. But it was solid. 
It was foundation-based. And I never gave back those gains because the foundation held. 
 The Three-Month Rule: Building Habits, Not Chasing Profits 
Here's a commitment I make to every trader I mentor: 


=== PAGE {} ===
Give me three months of perfect money management discipline, and I'll show you a transformed 
account. Not because three months is magical. But because: It takes approximately 66 days to form 
a habit (research by Philippa Lally, UCL). 
Three months = ~90 days = enough time to rewire your brain to: 
- Calculate position size automatically before every trade 
- Accept losses without emotional reaction 
- Take profits at predetermined targets without greed 
- Skip trades that don't meet your criteria without FOMO 
 The 90-Day Money Management Challenge 
Month 1: The Awareness Phase 
- Risk only 1% per trade 
- Track every trade in a journal 
- Note your emotional state at entry/exit 
- Observe how much easier it is to sleep when you're not over-leveraged 
Month 2: The Resistance Phase 
- You'll be tempted to break rules ("just this once, I'll risk 5%") 
- You'll see others making "big money" with reckless trades 
- You'll feel like 1% is "too slow" 
- Resist. Stay disciplined. 
Month 3: The Integration Phase 
- Risk management becomes automatic 
- You feel *uncomfortable* taking oversized positions 
- You naturally think in terms of "how much can I lose" before "how much can I make" 
- You've become a different trader 


=== PAGE {} ===
After 90 days, you won't need to force discipline. It will be who you are. 
 The Detachment Principle: Love the Process, Not the Profits 
The fastest way to destroy your trading account? Emotional attachment to money. 
When you're attached: 
- Every loss feels personal 
- Every profit creates euphoria that clouds judgment 
- Every drawdown creates panic 
- Every winning streak creates overconfidence 
Money becomes your identity, and the market becomes your emotional abuser. 
 How I Detached (And How You Can Too) 
I stopped thinking about money in trades. I started thinking about units of risk. 
Instead of "I'm risking ₹10,000 on this trade," I think: "I'm risking 1 unit." 
Instead of "I made ₹50,000 today," I think: "I executed 5 trades, 4 were profitable, my average win 
was 1.5 units." 
By abstracting away from rupees, I removed the emotional charge. The money is just a score, like 
points in a video game. The goal isn't the score—it's playing the game correctly. When you master 
the game (strategy, discipline, risk management), the score takes care of itself. 
 The Indian Market Context: Why Money Management Is Non-Negotiable Here 
The Indian derivatives market has specific characteristics that make money management even 
more critical: 
 1. High Leverage 
Nifty futures require only ~10-15% margin. Bank Nifty options can be leveraged 10-20x. 
This amplifies both gains and losses. A 5% market move can mean 50-100% account swings. 
Without strict position sizing, leverage kills accounts. 
 2. Retail Domination 


=== PAGE {} ===
Over 90% of F&O volume is retail. Many are undercapitalized, emotional, and following tips. 
This creates wild premium swings and stop-loss hunts, especially on expiry days. 
Your money management must account for these manipulations. 
 3. Global Sensitivity 
Indian markets react to US Fed decisions, crude oil prices, FII flows, and geopolitical events. 
Overnight gap-ups/downs are common. If you're over-leveraged, a gap against you is catastrophic. 
Money management includes position sizing that survives overnight risk. 
 4. Tax Implications 
Short-term capital gains on F&O are taxed at slab rates (up to 30%). Losses can offset gains, but 
only within the financial year. 
Protecting profits through disciplined money management becomes even more important for tax 
efficiency. 
 The Berlin Money Management Framework 
Here's the exact framework I use: 
 Capital Allocation 
- Trading Capital: 70% of total funds 
- Reserve Capital: 30% (untouched, for drawdown recovery if needed) 
Example: ₹50L total → ₹35L trading, ₹15L reserve 
 Risk Per Trade 
- Standard: 1.5% of trading capital 
- High-conviction: 2.5% maximum 
- Experimental/learning: 0.5% 
Example on ₹35L: Standard risk = ₹52,500 per trade 
 Position Sizing Calculation 


=== PAGE {} ===
Risk ÷ Stop Loss Distance = Position Size 
Example: 
- Risk: ₹52,500 
- Stop loss: 15% below entry 
- Position size: ₹52,500 ÷ 0.15 = ₹3,50,000 
 Daily Loss Limit 
- Maximum: 3% of capital = ₹1,05,000 on ₹35L 
- After hitting this, STOP trading for the day 
 Weekly Review 
- Every Sunday, review the week's trades 
- Calculate win rate, average win/loss ratio 
- Adjust position sizing if capital has grown/shrunk significantly 
 Monthly Withdrawal (Once Profitable) 
- Withdraw 30% of monthly profits 
- This "locks in" gains and prevents giving everything back 
 The Bigger Picture: Why I Could Smile Through ₹70 Lakhs 
When I lost ₹70 lakhs, people thought I was in denial or losing my mind. But here's what I knew 
that they didn't: I had already made ₹2.4 crores in the previous 18 months. That ₹70 lakh drawdown 
was ~3% of my total gains over my trading career at that point. 
Was it painful? Yes. 
Was it catastrophic? No. 
Because I had built a system where: 
- I withdrew profits regularly (₹1.2 crores was already secured in investments) 
- I maintained reserve capital (₹40 lakhs untouched) 


=== PAGE {} ===
- I knew my edge was statistically proven over hundreds of trades 
The ₹70 lakh loss was noise in a larger symphony of sustained profitability. 
This is what the "bigger picture" means. 
When you zoom out—monthly, yearly, career-long—individual losses become insignificant if 
your money management is sound. 
 The Final Truth: You Can't Control the Market, But You Can Control Your Exposure 
Every trader wants the "holy grail" strategy—the indicator combination that never loses. It doesn't 
exist. What does exist? A money management system so robust that even a mediocre strategy 
becomes profitable over time. You could flip a coin for trade direction (50/50 win rate), but with 
proper money management—risking 1%, taking profits at 2%, cutting losses religiously—you'd 
be profitable. 
Meanwhile, the best strategy in the world, if traded with reckless position sizing, will blow up 
accounts. The market will do what it wants. You control only one thing: how much you risk. Master 
that one thing, and you master trading. 
 Your 90-Day Challenge 
I'm issuing you a challenge right now: 
For the next 90 days, commit to perfect money management discipline: 
 
Risk only 1-2% per trade  
 
Calculate position size before every entry  
 
Set stop losses and honor them without exception  
 
Track every trade in a journal  
 
Review weekly and monthly performance  
 
Don't worry about profits. Don't compare yourself to others posting screenshots. 
 
Just focus on the process. 
In 90 days, come back to this article and tell me how your trading has transformed. Because it will. 
Not because the market changed. But because you built a foundation that can support the weight 
of real wealth. 
P.S. — That ₹70 lakh loss? It taught me more than my first ₹50 lakh profit ever did. Because 
losses reveal whether your foundation is concrete or sand. Mine was concrete. Is yours?

 Balls of Steel 
The Trade That Changed Everything 
They say in trading, your biggest wins come right after your darkest losses. December 30th, 
2024—MidCap Nifty expiry day—was supposed to be just another trading session. Instead, it 
became the day I learned what it truly means to trust your analysis when every fiber of your being 
is screaming to exit. Let me take you inside that room. Inside my head. Inside those nerve-wracking 
hours that felt like days. 
 The Setup: Rising from the Ashes 
I was coming up from my lows. 
Not just trading lows—psychological lows. You know that feeling when you've been beaten down 
by the market so many times that you question whether you belong here? That was me, weeks 
before this trade. But slowly, methodically, I had clawed my way back. Small profits. Consistent 
profits. Nothing spectacular, but enough to rebuild confidence. And I had some cushion under the 
belt now. 
That's when I decided: "Today, I take the calculated risk." 
It was MidCap Nifty expiry. The trend was clearly down—no debate there. Weekly charts, daily 
charts, everything pointed south. But here's the thing about intraday trading: the macro trend 
doesn't always translate to intraday reality. And that morning, despite the bearish trend, the index 
wasn't falling. It was stuck. Hovering. Teasing. 
 The Anomaly: When Premiums Don't Lie 
I pulled up my options chain, and something immediately caught my attention. The straddle values 
weren't decaying. 
For those who don't trade options religiously, let me explain: when the underlying isn't moving, 
straddle premiums should bleed due to theta decay. It's options 101. But that wasn't happening. 
Both calls and puts were holding their values stubbornly. 
That's when my senses tingled. "Suspicious activity." 
Someone was protecting these premiums. Smart money was positioning. And when smart money 
positions, they know something retail doesn't. The trend was down. Intraday action was sideways. 
But the options were screaming: "Something big is coming." I made my decision: I'm going with 
the trend. Downside. Puts. 
 The Accumulation: Building a Mountain 


=== PAGE {} ===
First Position: 1 Lakh Quantity 
I entered cautiously. Bought 1 lakh quantity of MidCap Nifty puts. 
Nothing happened. 
The price barely moved. My P&L sat there, flat as a pancake. 
Increased to 2 Lakhs 
Still nothing. 
3 Lakhs 
The market mocked me with its stillness. 
4 Lakhs 
At this point, most traders would panic. "Berlin, you're wrong. Exit. Cut your loss." But I stopped 
adding and started observing. This is crucial, guys. This is where amateur traders lose and 
professionals win. I didn't blindly keep adding. I paused. I watched. I analyzed the premium 
behavior. And you know what? The straddle 'still' wasn't losing value. That gave me confidence. 
Not hope—confidence. There's a massive difference. If I was wrong, these premiums would be 
getting crushed. But they weren't. Someone was absorbing all the selling pressure. 
I held. 
 The Trap: When Your Worst Nightmare Materializes. Then it happened. A sudden upmove. A 
spike against my position. My screen turned red. Blood red. 
Loss: ₹3.7 Lakhs 
My heart rate spiked. My palms got sweaty. That voice in your head—you know the one—started 
screaming: "You idiot! You're wrong! The trend reversed! Cut! CUT NOW!" 
But I looked at the candle. The last hour candle was barely bearish. It was a weak move. A trap. 
They were hunting stop losses. I knew it. But knowing and acting on that knowledge when you're 
staring at a ₹3.7 lakh loss? That's different. I waited for confirmation. Then price came back to my 
cost. 
 The Conviction: Doubling Down When Others Run. 
This was the moment of truth. Added 1 Lakh more. Total: 5 Lakhs Price rose 20% against me. 
Added 1 Lakh more. Total: 6 Lakhs. Price gained another 10%. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Added 1 Lakh more. Total: 7 Lakhs 
By now, you're probably thinking, "Berlin, are you insane?" 
Maybe. Or maybe I was seeing something others couldn't. I started observing the premiums again. 
The puts were hugely undervalued. HUGELY. Despite the price going against me, the put 
premiums weren't reflecting that movement proportionally. The math didn't add up unless... unless 
someone was deliberately suppressing them before the real move. 
Added 1 Lakh more. Total: 8 Lakhs. At 8 lakh quantity, my P&L started flickering like a broken 
neon sign: 
Green. Red. Green. Red. Green. Red. 
My heartbeat? Up. Up. UP. 
I'd never held a position this large. I didn't have the experience of accumulating at this scale. Every 
tick felt like an earthquake. But then, the P&L started holding the price. It stopped flickering and 
started stabilizing. 
"This is the moment," I told myself. The Test: Checking the Demand. Before I committed further, 
I needed proof. Real proof. 
I started exiting small quantities to test the market. 
Exited 3.8 Lakh quantity. 
And guess what? The price didn't fall even ₹0.50. Someone was buying everything I was throwing 
at the market. The demand was real. The buyers were waiting. That was my confirmation. That 
was when I exhaled and said to myself: "Calm down, Berlin. It's there. The move is coming." 
Added 1 Lakh more 
Another 1 Lakh 
Another 1 Lakh 
My maximum potential loss was now capped at ₹6 lakhs, but my position had grown massive. 
 The Position Reveal. Let me show you what I was holding: 
Total Quantity: Over 8 Lakh  
Average Entry: Carefully accumulated between key levels  
Maximum Loss: ₹6 Lakhs  


=== PAGE {} ===
Potential Gain: Unknown, but the setup was there 
Now came the hardest part: 'waiting.' 
The market doesn't care about your heart rate. It doesn't care that you've mortgaged your emotional 
stability on this trade. It moves when it wants to move. So I sat. And I waited. And I 'held.' 
 The Spike: When the Market Finally Speaks 
Then... BANG! The spike came. The kind of spike that justifies every second of doubt, every 
moment of fear, every rupee risked. MidCap Nifty started plummeting. My puts started exploding. 
₹2... ₹3... ₹5... ₹7... ₹9... 
My P&L was going vertical. But here's where inexperience almost destroyed everything. 
 The Chaos: When Everything Goes Wrong 
I was naive. I knew a momentum move was coming, but I didn't know how to 'exit' a position this 
large. This is what they don't teach you in courses. They teach you entries. They teach you risk 
management. But no one teaches you how to exit 8+ lakh quantity when the market is moving at 
lightning speed. I opened my basket orders. Panic set in. I started selling. Fast. Very fast. 'Very, 
very, VERY fast.' 
Then, disaster struck. 
My phone started ringing. My brother was calling. 
'Ring.' I cut the call. 
'Ring.' I cut again. 
'Ring.' Third time. I picked up, and as patiently as I could while my entire world was on fire, I 
said: 
"Not today, bhaiya. Not today..." 
And then... The broker app crashed. My screen froze. Time stopped. In those seconds—maybe it 
was five, maybe it was thirty—I experienced every emotion a trader can feel. Panic. Rage. 
Helplessness. Regret. I frantically reopened the app. The price had fallen from ₹9 to ₹4... then to 
₹0.90. I still had half my quantities. Half of my massive position, caught in the crash. I exited 
everything at whatever price I could get. The Aftermath: ₹10.75 Lakh Profit which was above ₹42 
Lakh a while ago. 
When the dust settled and I tallied everything: 


=== PAGE {} ===
Final Profit: ₹10,75,000. Ten lakh seventy-five thousand rupees. But here's what's important—I 
didn't celebrate immediately. I sat there, staring at my screen, processing what had just happened. 
Could it have been ₹35 lakhs? ₹42 lakhs? If the app hadn't crashed? If I'd known how to properly 
exit? Probably. But I didn't blame anyone. Not my brother. Not the broker. Not the universe. 
Because I understood something profound in that moment: 
"Jo hona tha wohi hua hai, aur jo hua hai achha hua hai." 
"What was meant to happen, happened. And what happened, happened for the best." 
 The Lessons: What That Day Taught Me. I learned two critical lessons that December day: 
 Lesson 1: Supply Management with Large Positions 
When you're holding massive quantity, you cannot dump everything at once. You'll kill your own 
profit. 
The correct process: 
- Sell a portion 
- Let the price absorb those orders 
- Let fresh buyers step in 
- Sell another portion 
- Repeat 
It's like selling a massive block of shares. You need to feed the market gradually, not choke it. 
 
 Lesson 2: Risk-Taking with Confirmation 
When the market is confirming you're right—when premiums behave exactly as they should, when 
test exits get absorbed instantly, when price action validates your thesis—that's when you 
*increase* your conviction, not decrease it. Most traders do the opposite. They take tiny positions 
when they're right and huge positions when they're wrong (averaging down). I did it backward that 
day, and it paid off. 
 The Real Education: Why I Can Predict Market Moves. Now do you understand? 
When I tell you 'before' a spike is coming, I'm not guessing. I'm not using some magical indicator. 
I'm simply recognizing patterns I've experienced firsthand. 


=== PAGE {} ===
When I explain how "they" (smart money) push price up just to hunt stop losses and distribute 
orders to retailers—I'm not theorizing. I've *been* on the other side of that transaction. 
When I say "watch the premium behavior, not just price action"—it's because I've seen ₹10+ lakh 
profit opportunities hiding in plain sight within option chain anomalies. 
The value I've paid to learn these lessons? 
Thousands of hours. Hundreds of losses. Mountains of stress. And one December day where 
everything could have gone catastrophically wrong but didn't. That's Why TradeLikeBerlin Is 
Different. Everything I teach comes from real market warfare. Battle scars. Actual capital risked. 
Real emotions managed. I don't guess market moves—I recognize them because I've survived 
them. I don't teach textbook strategies—I share what actually works when your capital is on the 
line and your heartbeat is drowning out your thoughts. 
That day taught me that trading isn't about being right all the time. It's about: 
- Reading market microstructure 
- Managing positions under extreme pressure 
- Trusting your analysis when everyone else (including your own fear) says you're wrong 
- Learning from both successes and failures 
- Understanding that sometimes, your biggest lesson comes wrapped in your biggest profit 
December 30th, 2024. MidCap Nifty expiry. The day I grew balls of steel.

 The Small Fish 
A Derivatives Market Parable 
Let me tell you a story. Not a fairy tale—a survival manual disguised as a parable. There was once 
a small fish in the vast ocean who dreamed of ruling it someday. Sound ambitious? Foolish, even? 
Wait until you hear the rest. 
 Birth: Entering the Ocean 
This little fish was born with more than 1,000 brothers and sisters. All hatched on the same day, 
all swimming in the same waters, all dreaming the same dreams of survival and success. In the 
derivatives market, this is your batch—the thousands of retail traders who open their first Demat 
accounts each month, funded with hope and capital, ready to conquer the markets. When she grew 
up a bit and began exploring the ocean, she saw the reality: there weren't just a thousand fish. There 
were 'lakhs' of them. Millions, even. All swimming, all hunting, all competing for the same 
opportunities. 
The ocean was crowded. Brutally crowded. The NSE derivatives segment sees crores of retail 
participants. You're not unique. You're one among millions, and the ocean doesn't care about your 
dreams. The Brutal Reality: Survival of the Fittest. As she continued to grow, something horrifying 
became clear. Her brothers and sisters—the ones born alongside her, the ones who started this 
journey together—were disappearing. 
One by one. Eaten. Killed. Eliminated. 
Some got too greedy and swam into the territory of bigger fish. Some panicked during turbulent 
currents and became easy prey. Some simply didn't learn fast enough. 
This is the 90% statistic you've heard about—90% of retail traders lose money in derivatives. 
They're not just numbers. They're your batchmates. The Telegram group members who went silent. 
The YouTube comment section warriors who suddenly stopped posting their "profits." The cousins 
who tried trading for three months and returned to their jobs, defeated. 
But our little fish survived. Why? Luck and a little bit of cleverness. She didn't do anything 
extraordinary at first. She just avoided the obvious traps. When other fish rushed toward bait, she 
hesitated. When predators circled, she hid. When currents got rough, she found shelter. 
In trading terms: She didn't blow up her account in the first month. She didn't YOLO into weekly 
options on news days. She didn't revenge trade after losses. She survived long enough to observe. 
 The Hierarchy: Understanding the Food Chain 
As she explored deeper into the ocean, she began to understand the brutal hierarchy: 


=== PAGE {} ===
Small fishes get eaten by big fishes. 
Retail traders with ₹50,000 accounts get stopped out and trapped by institutional algorithms. Your 
stop loss at obvious support? They see it. They trigger it. They profit from your predictability. 
Big fishes get eaten by bigger ones. 
Proprietary trading firms with crores in capital get squeezed out by hedge funds with hundreds of 
crores. The HFT firms with microsecond advantages harvest the slightly slower algorithmic 
traders. 
The bigger ones get eaten by the whale—the one who rules the ocean. 
And at the top? Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), the whales with thousands of crores, who 
can move markets with their order flow. When they decide a sector is overvalued, it falls. When 
they accumulate, it rises. They don't predict the ocean's movements—they CREATE them. 
The little fish observed all of this with growing wisdom. The Realization: Size Isn't Everything, 
But It Matters. She came to understand a harsh truth: 
A small fish can never rule the ocean. 
Not because small fish lack intelligence. Not because they lack courage. But because in the ocean, 
size provides: 
- Sustainability: Big fish can survive longer without food (capital drawdowns) 
- Defense: Thick scales protect against attacks (risk management capacity) 
- Offense: Strength to hunt bigger prey (capital to move positions and absorb volatility) 
- Respect: Other fish think twice before attacking (market impact that others must consider) 
In derivatives trading, a ₹5 lakh account behaves differently than a ₹5 crore account. It's not just 
about skill—it's about capacity to weather storms, absorb losses, scale positions, and exploit 
opportunities that require staying power. 
But here's what she also understood: 
To rule the ocean, you must first survive. Because when you survive, you continue to grow. This 
became her philosophy. Her north star. 
Not "How do I get rich quickly?" But "How do I survive long enough to become dangerous?" 
 The Transformation: From Prey to Predator 


=== PAGE {} ===
She observed the patterns: 
When you survive, you gain experience day by day. 
Every survived drawdown teaches you risk management. Every avoided trap teaches you market 
manipulation. Every profitable quarter teaches you what actually works versus what gurus sell. 
You get sharper day by day. 
Your pattern recognition improves. You start seeing option chain anomalies before the move. You 
sense when premiums are being manipulated. You recognize distribution disguised as breakouts. 
You get finer day by day. 
Your entries become precise. Your exits become emotionless. Your position sizing becomes 
mathematical. Your strategy becomes a repeatable process, not a random hope. 
And crucially, you grow by size day by day. 
₹50,000 becomes ₹2 lakhs. ₹2 lakhs becomes ₹10 lakhs. ₹10 lakhs becomes ₹50 lakhs. Not through 
gambling—through compound survival. Small, consistent profits that don't get given back. 
The little fish understood the equation: 
Survival + Time = Growth  
Growth + Experience =  SMALL FISH: A Derivatives Market Parable 
Let me tell you a story. Not a fairy tale—a survival manual disguised as a parable. There was once

Proprietary trading firms with crores in capital get squeezed out by hedge funds with hundreds of 
crores. The HFT firms with microsecond advantages harvest the slightly slower algorithmic 
traders. The bigger ones get eaten by the whale—the one who rules the ocean. 


=== PAGE {} ===
And at the top? Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), the whales with thousands of crores, who 
can move markets with their order flow. When they decide a sector is overvalued, it falls. When 
they accumulate, it rises. They don't predict the ocean's movements—they CREATE them. 
The little fish observed all of this with growing wisdom. 
 The Realization: Size Isn't Everything, But It Matters 
She came to understand a harsh truth: A small fish can never rule the ocean. Not because small 
fish lack intelligence. Not because they lack courage. But because in the ocean, size provides: 
- Sustainability: Big fish can survive longer without food (capital drawdowns) 
- Defense: Thick scales protect against attacks (risk management capacity) 
- Offense: Strength to hunt bigger prey (capital to move positions and absorb volatility) 
- Respect: Other fish think twice before attacking (market impact that others must consider) 
In derivatives trading, a ₹5 lakh account behaves differently than a ₹5 crore account. It's not just 
about skill—it's about capacity to weather storms, absorb losses, scale positions, and exploit 
opportunities that require staying power. 
But here's what she also understood: To rule the ocean, you must first survive. Because when you 
survive, you continue to grow. This became her philosophy. Her north star. Not "How do I get rich 
quickly?" But "How do I survive long enough to become dangerous?" 
 The Transformation: From Prey to Predator 
She observed the patterns: 
When you survive, you gain experience day by day. 
Every survived drawdown teaches you risk management. Every avoided trap teaches you market 
manipulation. Every profitable quarter teaches you what actually works versus what gurus sell. 
You get sharper day by day. 
Your pattern recognition improves. You start seeing option chain anomalies before the move. You 
sense when premiums are being manipulated. You recognize distribution disguised as breakouts. 
You get finer day by day. 
Your entries become precise. Your exits become emotionless. Your position sizing becomes 
mathematical. Your strategy becomes a repeatable process, not a random hope. 


=== PAGE {} ===
And crucially, you grow by size day by day. 
₹50,000 becomes ₹2 lakhs. ₹2 lakhs becomes ₹10 lakhs. ₹10 lakhs becomes ₹50 lakhs. Not through 
gambling—through compound survival. Small, consistent profits that don't get given back. 
The little fish understood the equation: 
Survival + Time = Growth  
Growth + Experience = Strength  
Strength + Strategy = The ability to challenge the whale 
 The Mindset Shift: From Offense to Defense. Earlier, she used to hurry. 
Like new traders who open 10 positions a day, chase every breakout, trade every news event, and 
confuse activity with progress. She wanted quick results. She wanted to prove herself. She wanted 
to become big 'now.' But after seeing what happened to those who hurried—her brothers and sisters 
lying on the ocean floor—she changed. 
She became defensive and wise. She stopped asking, "How much can I make today?" She started 
asking, "How do I ensure I'm here tomorrow?" 
This is the shift every successful trader makes—from P&L obsession to process obsession. From 
profit targets to risk management. From aggression to patience. 
She had just one goal now: "To get stronger and to survive." Not "to get rich." Not "to prove 
doubters wrong." Not "to quit my job in six months." 
Just: Survive. Get stronger. Repeat. 
 As years passed, the transformation became visible: 
The little fish turned bigger. 
₹50,000 became ₹5 lakhs. ₹5 lakhs became ₹25 lakhs. ₹25 lakhs became ₹1 crore. Not linear 
growth—exponential growth punctuated by drawdowns, but always with capital preservation as 
the foundation. 
She fought. 
Against stop loss hunts. Against margin calls. Against FOMO. Against overconfidence after 
winning streaks. Against despair after losing streaks. 
She defended herself. 


=== PAGE {} ===
With position sizing. With stop losses honored religiously. With portfolio diversification. With 
emotional discipline. With continuous learning. She learned to read the ocean's currents—where 
smart money was accumulating, where retail was being trapped, when volatility spikes were 
genuine versus manufactured. 
She mastered option chain analysis. She understood put-call ratios. She recognized when max pain 
would magnetically pull prices. She saw through false breakouts before they collapsed. 
And one day... 
The whale heard about her. 
 The Confrontation: When Two Giants Collide 
News travels in the ocean. 
The whale—the market maker, the institutional player, the one who had ruled this territory for 
decades—heard about a fish who refused to be eaten. A fish who had grown. A fish who was 
taking positions large enough to be noticed. 
The whale got hasty. Perhaps arrogant. 
This is what happens when institutional players encounter a skilled, well-capitalized retail trader 
who understands their games. They don't ignore you anymore. They acknowledge your presence 
by trying to shake you out. 
The whale attacked. Sudden volatility spikes. Stop loss hunts at obvious levels. Gap openings 
designed to trigger panic. Premium manipulation to create doubt. 
Every advanced trader faces this moment—when your position size is large enough that you feel 
the market "knows" you're there. When your stops get hunted with surgical precision. When entries 
that worked with ₹2 lakh positions suddenly fail with ₹20 lakh positions. 
But here's what the whale didn't know: 
Where this fish came from. 
 The Battle: Experience vs. Arrogance 
The whale had size. The whale had capital. The whale had decades of experience crushing small 
fish. 
But this fish? She came from the scratch. She had survived when 90% of her peers died. She had 
learned through pain, not theory. She had grown through discipline, not luck. She knew every trap 
because she'd seen her siblings fall into them. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Both fought. 
The whale used its traditional weapons: 
- Massive orders to move prices against her position 
- Overnight gap downs to trigger stop losses 
- Premium decay manipulation 
- Creating false breakouts 
But the fish fought with cleverness and strength: 
- She used options strategies that benefited from volatility, not just direction 
- She sized positions to survive maximum drawdown 
- She recognized the whale's patterns because she'd studied them for years 
- She didn't panic when the ocean churned—she'd been through worse 
The fish fought with cleverness born of survival. 
She used ratio spreads when the whale tried to spike volatility. She bought the dips that scared 
everyone else because she recognized accumulation patterns. She held through turbulence because 
her risk management allowed her to. 
She fought with strength built through years. 
Her capital could absorb the whale's attacks. Her psychology could handle the drawdowns. Her 
strategy had been stress-tested through multiple market cycles. 
 The Outcome: When Preparation Meets Opportunity. But it was the hurry of the whale that buried 
it. The whale was used to crushing opposition quickly. It was used to small fish panicking and 
exiting at losses. It was used to its size being enough. It didn't respect this fish's journey. It attacked 
with arrogance instead of strategy. It increased aggression when patience was required. 
In market terms: The institutional player over-leveraged. It assumed the pattern would play out 
like always. It didn't respect the evolved retail trader's risk management and staying power. It 
created a position so large that when it failed, the reversal was catastrophic. 
The whale lost. 
Not because it was incompetent. Not because it lacked resources. But because it underestimated 
an opponent who had survived everything the ocean could throw at her. 


=== PAGE {} ===
 The New Ruler: Full Circle 
The fish became the new ruler of the ocean. More importantly, she became the new whale. 
In trading terms: She reached the tier where her capital size, strategy sophistication, and market 
understanding allowed her to move from reacting to the market to influencing it. Her positions 
became large enough that others had to consider her presence. Her track record became the case 
study others referenced. 
But here's the beautiful irony: 
She never forgot being the small fish. She never forgot the brothers and sisters who didn't make it. 
She never forgot the lessons of survival, caution, and respect for the ocean's power. That's what 
made her a better ruler than the previous whale. 
 The Moral: Your Journey in the Derivatives Ocean 
If you're reading this, you're the small fish right now. You've just entered the ocean. You see 
millions of other fish. You've probably already lost some friends—traders who started with you 
but blew up and quit. The derivatives market is this ocean. F&O trading is the deepest, darkest, 
most dangerous part of it, where the biggest predators hunt. And you, with your ₹50,000 or ₹2 
lakh account, are the small fish with big dreams. 
So what do you do? You survive. 
Not by being reckless. Not by being fearless. Not by "betting big to win big." 
You survive by being smart, defensive, and patient. 
You accept that: 
- You won't rule the ocean tomorrow 
- Your brothers and sisters (fellow new traders) will mostly disappear 
- The big fish (proprietary traders) will eat you if you're careless 
- The whales (institutions) can crush you without thinking 
But you also understand: 
If you survive long enough, you grow. Day by day. Trade by trade. Lesson by lesson. Your ₹50,000 
becomes ₹5 lakhs through compound discipline, not lottery trades. Your ₹5 lakhs becomes ₹50 
lakhs through years of pattern recognition and risk management. Your ₹50 lakhs becomes ₹5 
crores through scaling a proven, repeatable process. And one day—maybe in 5 years, maybe in 


=== PAGE {} ===
10—you'll be the whale. Not because you got lucky. But because you survived when others didn't, 
and survival in this ocean is the rarest skill of all. 
 The Berlin Message 
This isn't just a story. This is the roadmap. 
I was that small fish in 2020. Starting with dreams bigger than my account size. Watching friends 
blow up. Getting stopped out by algorithms I didn't understand. Feeling like the ocean was rigged 
against me. 
But I survived. 
Through discipline when I wanted to gamble. Through defense when I wanted to attack. Through 
patience when I wanted results NOW. 
And slowly—so slowly it was almost imperceptible—I grew. I'm not the whale yet. But I'm no 
longer the small fish either. And every day, I grow a little more. So here's my question to you: 
Will you be the small fish who rushes into the whale's mouth seeking quick riches? 
Or will you be the small fish who survives, learns, grows, and one day rules the ocean? 
The choice is yours. 
But remember: The ocean doesn't care about your dreams. It only respects your survival.

 Berlin Wisdom 
Lessons Forged in Fire 
 ON STRUGGLE AND ENTITLEMENT 
If you think the market will hand you anything without a fight, you're already defeated. The market 
doesn't owe you profits. It doesn't care about your bills, your dreams, or your desperation. Every 
rupee you earn must be wrestled from the jaws of uncertainty. Stop waiting for luck. Luck is what 
amateurs call probability they don't understand. Always take risk after complete study. Approach 
every trade as if luck doesn't exist—because in 99 out of 100 cases, it doesn't. The 1% you attribute 
to luck? That's just preparation meeting opportunity while you weren't looking. 
 ON PATIENCE AND TIMING 
"There is a time for everything." 
You're planting seeds in a forest where some trees take years to bear fruit. Learn to keep the 
patience. Keep moving forward. Keep applying knowledge. The market has a clock you can't see, 
running on rhythms you can't control. But trust this: When your time comes—and it will come—
you'll receive everything you've earned through patience and persistence. Not a moment sooner. 
Not a rupee less. 
ON THE 80/20 RULE 
Trading is 80% waiting, 20% execution. 
Read that again until it rewrites your brain. The amateur thinks trading means action—clicking 
buttons, entering positions, "doing something." The professional knows trading means *waiting* 
for the perfect setup, then executing with precision. Patience makes you profitable. Overtrading 
destroys your capital. Every unnecessary trade is a slow leak in your boat. Eventually, you sink—
not from one catastrophic loss, but from a thousand small bleeds you could have avoided by simply 
doing nothing. 
ON LEARNING FROM YOUR PAST 
"Take the mistakes you've made in the past... implement the lessons you've learned... and see 
yourself in the future. You'll be different." 
Your past failures aren't anchors—they're fuel. Every blown account, every emotional trade, every 
ignored stop loss carries a lesson. Extract it. Absorb it. Become it. The trader you are today is not 
the trader you'll be six months from now—'if' you're willing to evolve. The worse a situation 
becomes, the less it takes to turn it around. The bigger the upside. 


=== PAGE {} ===
When you're at rock bottom, every correct decision compounds. You're not starting from zero—
you're starting from wisdom earned through pain. That's an unfair advantage over those who 
haven't yet paid the tuition. 
 ON RISK MANAGEMENT (THE NON-NEGOTIABLE) 
"The only thing that can make you successful in option buying is risk management. You have to 
cut your losses. You have to cut your losses. You HAVE to cut your losses." 
I'll say it three times because traders need to hear it a thousand times before they actually do it. 
Your stop loss isn't a suggestion. It's not flexible. It's not "let me give it a few more minutes to 
recover." It's the one rule that stands between you and oblivion. Hope is not a strategy. Holding a 
losing position and praying is not trading—it's gambling with extra steps. 
Cut. Your. Losses. 
The market will give you infinite opportunities to make money. It only needs to take your capital 
once to end the game permanently. 
 ON WINNING STREAKS (THE HIDDEN DANGER) 
"If you had a good winning streak, reduce your position size after tripling your first loss following 
that streak." This is counterintuitive, so pay attention. Everyone thinks winning streaks mean 
"increase size, maximize gains." Wrong. Winning streaks breed overconfidence. They make you 
sloppy. They convince you that you've "figured out" the market. The market is about to teach you 
humility. When your first loss after a streak hits, and especially if it triples, that's the market 
whispering: "You're getting reckless." Listen to that whisper. Reduce size. Observe your decision-
making. Are you still trading your system, or are you trading your ego? 
Don't increase position sizing after tripling a loss. That's how you donate months of profits back 
to the market in one catastrophic week. 
ON TIMING AND VOLATILITY 
"There is a time to buy options. There is a time to hedge options. Know the time and wait for the 
time." 
Options aren't stocks. You can't "buy and hold" your way to success. Timing isn't everything—it's 
the 'only' thing. Knowing the volatility is the most important factor in options. I'm repeating: 
KNOW THE VOLATILITY OF OPTIONS. Buy options when volatility is low and about to spike. 
Sell options when volatility is high and about to collapse. Sounds simple? It is. But simple doesn't 
mean easy. Most traders do the opposite—they buy during panic (high IV) and sell during calm 
(low IV), then wonder why they consistently lose despite being "right" about direction. 
Know when to act. More importantly, know when to do nothing. 


=== PAGE {} ===
 ON SELF-BELIEF 
"There is nothing you can't achieve. Believe in yourself and believe in your creativity." 
Everything you need is already inside you. The strategies. The discipline. The resilience. You're 
not lacking tools—you're lacking trust in yourself. Trust yourself. Believe in your knowledge. 
Nothing is impossible if you're willing to work for it. But understand: belief without action is 
delusion. Belief backed by relentless practice? That's destiny shaping itself. 
 ON EMBRACING FAILURE 
"Let the disappointment come. Be ready to welcome it with a smile. Be ready to learn from it." 
Losses will find you. Drawdowns will humble you. Trades you were certain about will fail 
spectacularly. Good. Every disappointment is a teacher wearing a mask. Remove the mask. Learn 
the lesson. Repeat the process—but not the mistake. You're stronger than you think. You've 
survived every bad trade, every red day, every moment of doubt so far. You're still here. That's not 
luck—that's resilience. 
ON THE MYTH OF OVERNIGHT SUCCESS 
"Do not believe in overnight gains. Do not believe in luck. Believe in your knowledge. Believe in 
yourself. Believe in your trade." 
The Instagram screenshots of ₹10,000 to ₹10,00,000 in a week? Lies. Survivorship bias. 
Photoshop. Or the prelude to a spectacular blowup you won't see posted. Real success is boring. 
It's slow. It's compounding small edges over months and years. Move slow. Start again. Don't 
doubt yourself based on someone else's highlight reel. Move in silence. Let your success be the 
noise. Let them laugh at your small account while you're learning. Let them mock your 
conservative position sizing while you're surviving. When you're profitable three years from now 
and they've blown up twice and quit, your consistent returns will speak louder than their temporary 
screenshots ever did. 
 ON ADAPTABILITY 
"Old things pass away and new ones come to take their place. A wise man changes his mind; a 
fool never does." 
The market evolves. Strategies that worked last year might fail this year. Edges decay. Volatility 
regimes shift. Clinging to what worked before is how you become obsolete. Be water. Adapt. 
Evolve. Change your mind when evidence demands it. That's not weakness—that's intelligence. 
The fool says, "This is how I've always traded." The wise trader says, "This is what's working 
now." 
ON LOSING STREAKS (THE SURVIVAL PROTOCOL) 


=== PAGE {} ===
"Daily hitting a new bottom indicates much lower prices can be achieved. Preserve capital 
overnight when you're in a losing streak." 
When you're losing, everything changes: 
 
Cut down your position size  
 
Minimize your trading activity  
 
Trade small or not at all 
Trading during a losing streak is emotionally draining and it will never end well. You're not 
thinking clearly. Your risk assessment is compromised. Your patience is exhausted. This is not the 
time to "trade your way out." This is the time to stop the bleeding, reset psychologically, and return 
when your mind is clear. 
ON OPPORTUNITIES 
"Opportunities come on a 'first come, first served' basis. They reward those with brains, guts, and 
determination." The market doesn't wait for you to be ready. It doesn't announce opportunities with 
a trumpet. You have to find them where others have overlooked them. You have to press on where 
others have fallen short. The edge goes to those who are prepared, patient, and present when the 
moment arrives. 
 ON SYSTEMS OVER OUTCOMES 
"You won't profit on numbers. Stop focusing on numbers. Believe in the process. Love the system. 
Trade the system." Your P&L today doesn't matter. Your P&L this week doesn't matter. What 
matters is: Are you executing your system with discipline? Your aim is to become the best trader 
who loves to trade—not one who loves winning. Loving winning makes you fragile. Every loss 
destroys you. Loving the process makes you antifragile. Losses become data. Wins become 
validation. 
Edge. Risk-Reward System. Plans. Execution. That's the hierarchy. Master it. 
 ON MINDSET AND IMAGINATION 
"The unexpected happens every time, and the small-minded can't make sense of it." 
Big trades—career-defining trades—exist far away from consensus thinking. But first, you need 
the guts to *imagine* them. To think beyond "₹5,000 profit today." To envision the ₹10 lakh trade. 
The ₹50 lakh year. Train your mind to expect it. To imagine it. Because if you can't see it in your 
mind, you'll never recognize it when the market offers it. 
 ON MISTAKES (THE ONLY ESCAPE) 
"There's only one way to escape the cycle of loss: Learn from mistakes and don't repeat them." 


=== PAGE {} ===
That's it. That's the entire formula. Not fancy indicators. Not expensive courses. Not secret groups. 
Learn. Adapt. Don't repeat. Every repeated mistake is a choice. Choose differently. 
ON FLOWING WITH THE MARKET 
"Don't question why the market is moving. Just follow the flow." 
The market doesn't owe you explanations. It moves. Your job is to move with it. Trying to trade 
against the flow of the market will teach you painful lessons. You can't swim against the river. 
When the current is strong, swim with it. When it changes direction, change with it. Stubbornness 
is expensive. 
ON UNDERSTANDING CAUSE AND EFFECT 
"Everything has a reason. You just don't know the cause behind it yet." 
When a trade fails, don't rage. Don't blame manipulation. Ask: "What was the reason behind this 
move?" With a cool mind, seek to understand. The right cause, once understood, will illuminate 
future trades. Understanding is light. Confusion is darkness. Choose light. 
ON PATIENCE IN EXECUTION 
"Have patience so that impatience works in your favor." While you wait calmly for the perfect 
setup, others are frantically trading, racking up costs, and bleeding capital. Their impatience is 
your edge. Find strong reasons behind trades. Don't make hasty decisions. Trade with the flow. 
Wait for clarity. Execute with conviction. 
 THE BERLIN CODE 
These aren't just quotes. They're survival principles forged in the fire of real losses, real pressure, 
and real growth. Internalize them. Let them become reflexes. Because the market doesn't care 
about motivation. It cares about discipline. And discipline, repeated over time, is what separates 
those who survive from those who become cautionary tales. Trade like Berlin. Think long-term. 
Execute with precision. Survive first. Profit second. Everything else is noise.

 The Door Is Open—Now Walk Through It 
You've reached the end of the book, but this is where your real journey begins. 
Over the past chapters, you've been given access to knowledge that most retail traders will never 
encounter: Numerical Theory, Value Adjustment Theory, Adjustment Theory, Big Money Theory, 
and the psychological frameworks that separate the 9% who profit from the 91% who lose. 
But let me be honest with you about something crucial: 
What's documented in these pages represents perhaps 10% of what Berlin knows about trading. 
Not because we held back deliberately, but because the other 90% cannot be written down. It can 
only be learned through experience—through thousands of hours watching price action, through 
the emotional crucible of holding a losing position, through the discipline of letting winners run 
when every instinct screams to exit. 
Berlin has given you the direction. The most important 10%. The foundation upon which 
everything else is built. He's shown you where to look: the 3% moves that create Numerical Theory 
opportunities, the premium dislocations that Value Adjustment exploits, the accumulation zones 
where Big Money entered, the final 15-minute chaos where Adjustment Theory thrives. But he 
cannot walk the path for you. 
Think of this book as a detailed map of treacherous terrain that Berlin has already crossed. The 
map shows you where the traps are, where the shortcuts exist, which paths lead to cliffs, and which 
lead to treasure. It's accurate because it was drawn by someone who survived the journey. But a 
map doesn't transport you to the destination. You still have to walk. 
The door to consistent profitability is now open in front of you. Berlin has unlocked it, pushed it 
wide, and illuminated what lies beyond. You can see the path clearly: disciplined position sizing, 
ruthless stop losses, patient entries, bold holding of winners, systematic application of proven 
strategies. But only you can step through that door. 
No one can do it for you. Not Berlin. Not me. Not your mentor or your trading group or your 
family cheering you on. This is a journey you must make alone—alone with your capital, your 
emotions, your discipline, and your commitment to the rules you've learned. 
Some of you will walk through immediately. You'll close this book, open your trading journal, and 
begin the 90-day discipline challenge. You'll paper trade for 20 setups before risking real money. 
You'll follow the rules without deviation. In six months, you'll message me with screenshots not 
to brag, but to say "thank you—it worked exactly as described." 
Some of you will hesitate at the threshold. You'll understand intellectually but lack the emotional 
readiness. You'll try one strategy, break the rules, lose money, and blame the framework. The door 
remains open, but you'll convince yourself it's locked. And some of you will walk through the door 


=== PAGE {} ===
and then turn back. You'll have early success, get overconfident, increase position sizing 
recklessly, hit a losing streak, and retreat to your old habits. The journey will seem too difficult, 
the discipline too demanding. But a few of you—the ones who truly internalize what Berlin has 
shared—will walk through that door and never look back. 
You'll become the trader who: 
- Sees a 3.4% move and immediately knows which strike to buy and where to enter 
- Spots premium dislocations on expiry day that others miss entirely 
- Follows institutional footprints by identifying accumulation zones 
- Holds a ₹50,000 position until it becomes ₹2,00,000 because you trust the process 
- Loses ₹15,000 without emotion because your stop loss was honored and your risk was defined 
- Withdraws ₹2,00,000 in profits every quarter to your secured account 
- Operates with the calm precision of the 9% minority 
That trader already exists inside you. This book has simply revealed them. The strategies work—
the mathematics guarantee it. Berlin has proven it with ₹2+ crores in profits. The edge is real. The 
frameworks are sound. The only variable is your execution. 
Will you follow the rules when emotions scream otherwise? Will you cut losses when ego demands 
holding? Will you let winners run when fear begs for early exits? Will you practice for weeks 
before going live? Will you track every trade, review every mistake, and continuously refine your 
execution? If yes, then six months from now, you'll be unrecognizable as a trader. 
Your account will be larger. Your confidence will be unshakeable. Your discipline will be 
automatic. And you'll understand what Berlin meant when he said: "The market doesn't reward 
hope. It rewards preparation." If no, then this book will become another resource you read but 
didn't apply, another opportunity you understood but didn't seize. The difference between those 
outcomes has nothing to do with intelligence, capital, or market conditions. It has everything to do 
with commitment. 
So let me ask you directly: Are you ready to walk through the door? 
Are you ready to spend 90 days in perfect discipline, building the habits that separate professionals 
from amateurs? Are you ready to paper trade until your entries become instinctive? Are you ready 
to risk real capital only when your rules are honored automatically? 
Are you ready to become the trader Berlin has shown you that you can be? 
The door is open. The path is clear. The destination is visible. 


=== PAGE {} ===
Everything you need to succeed is in your hands. 
Now comes the exciting part—the part no book can teach, no mentor can walk for you, no course 
can simulate. 
The journey itself. 
The moment you close this book and open your trading platform with Berlin's frameworks in your 
mind and his discipline in your heart—that's when the real education begins. That's when you 
discover the other 90%. And that discovery? That earned wisdom? That battle-tested confidence? 
That will be yours. Uniquely yours. Because you walked through the door. Welcome to the 9% 
club. Berlin is waiting for you on the other side. 
Now go. Trade. Survive. Thrive. 
"The direction has been given. The door has been opened. Now the journey—the most exciting 
part—belongs entirely to you." — Berlin 
THE END 
(Or rather, THE BEGINNING).
